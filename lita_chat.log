[2016-05-12 16:26:56 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] Smither, you only see in lsmod if other modules use the module, not if userland uses it
[2016-05-12 16:27:40 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] seems I got late to that one
[2016-05-12 16:28:03 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i guess he deactivated the anonymous function :>
[2016-05-12 16:29:17 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] Smither, look with xinput and/or /dev/input/mice again... I guess you can try loading all modules from /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/input/mouse/ and see if there's any recognitiion

[2016-05-12 16:57:44 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And I don't think it is just YouTube, I think my net connection is slow.
[2016-05-12 16:58:51 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I went to the github link from polyzen and Iceweasel was showing it was still loading. (The indicator was still going around and around and around.)
[2016-05-12 16:58:57 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i've never met anyone talking about gluten in real life. the only reason i hate this thing is the internet :D

[2016-05-12 16:59:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Let's get off of hate, I have a cute kitten who is being adorable at the moment.
[2016-05-12 17:00:12 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] THough any moment she could strike with little warning.
[2016-05-12 17:00:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i find it a little odd that it's sometimes easier to find gluten free alternatives than vegan ones. protect the wheat!
[2016-05-12 17:01:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] must be a NA thing.
[2016-05-12 17:02:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I could never be gluten free or vegan. I love hamburgers.
[2016-05-12 17:02:26 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] yeah probably. there's always several diet fads happening at once, gluten free is a common element to a lot of them i think
[2016-05-12 17:02:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i'm not vegan, just vegetarian, but i miss burgers. veggieburgers are good, but not quite the same
[2016-05-12 17:03:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I don't know the difference, but I've never cared to look into it.
[2016-05-12 17:04:09 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i try to keep it to meat once a week. mostly eat at a canteen that has lots of vegetarian options, so that's nice.
[2016-05-12 17:04:30 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] vegans don't eat any animal products (eggs, milk etc). vegetarians don't eat meat, but do eat eggs, milk
[2016-05-12 17:05:03 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I could never be without milk, especially since hubby works in the industry.
[2016-05-12 17:05:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i love cheese and ice cream too much. there are some okay vegan ice creams.. the vegan cheeses are still a work in progress
[2016-05-12 17:06:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] when i do get cravings for meat it's alway for the worst kinds like KFC or McDonalds.. effects of marketing i guess
