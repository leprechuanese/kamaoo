[2016-05-24 00:09:13 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: ambient authority is everywhere
[2016-05-24 00:09:38 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] if only midori had been released
[2016-05-24 00:10:58 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] rjsalts: how does midori security works?
[2016-05-24 00:11:30 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: object capability security

[2016-05-24 00:30:34 -0500] [sukhoi in #debian] hi
[2016-05-24 00:30:48 -0500] [yurakeshi in #debian] hello =)
[2016-05-24 00:32:53 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] rjsalts: interesting, so they wrap webkit in a container with object oriented wrapper libraries for accessing of resources:)
[2016-05-24 00:33:40 -0500] [galex-713 in #debian] are guile-sdl and guile-ncurse packaged with guile?
[2016-05-24 00:34:26 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] you can't get a resource without being given it, you then design your apis so that they have to be called with both an operation and a resource
[2016-05-24 00:34:28 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] rjsalts: do midori also have ublock origin?
[2016-05-24 00:35:03 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: midori was never released, it was shuttered by Microsoft mid-late 2015
[2016-05-24 00:35:19 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Ah, ok.
[2016-05-24 00:35:54 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] microsoft have a lxc wrapper thing around its operating system anyway... in windows 10.
[2016-05-24 00:36:46 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] it was rumoured that it would be released as a product, but was not to be
[2016-05-24 00:36:51 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] microkernel stuff
[2016-05-24 00:36:54 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] ?
[2016-05-24 00:37:21 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] I mean unikernel
[2016-05-24 00:37:51 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] or the linux syscall stuff?
[2016-05-24 00:39:13 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] rjsalts: i'm not sure about the details, I dont know where that article I read went, got it from someone who know someone inside microsoft. After what I remember.. they did what I explained abow: update routine in a microkernel, and container around everything else.
[2016-05-24 00:40:49 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] inspired by seccomp and lxc.
[2016-05-24 00:42:43 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] They also are able to detect if a given signature leaves the operating system.
[2016-05-24 00:43:26 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Like, a private key.
[2016-05-24 00:43:50 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] So they know if they have been compromised.
[2016-05-24 00:43:56 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] and then they fix it with an update.
[2016-05-24 00:46:52 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] So if the network interface detects that the root password leaves the network, then they know something is in trouble.
[2016-05-24 00:47:10 -0500] [darxmurf in #debian] hi all
[2016-05-24 00:47:54 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] and they are 100% sure about it. Even when encryption inside the os is used.
[2016-05-24 00:48:10 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] like a form of memory tagging I belive.
[2016-05-24 00:55:26 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] rjsalts: does that exist for Linux?:)
[2016-05-24 01:14:16 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] no idea, I haven't heard of it
[2016-05-24 01:27:52 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] Hi, how close is gNewSense to Debian? I understand it to be Debian sans non-free things and Debian branding.
[2016-05-24 01:30:58 -0500] [mutante in #debian] notadrop: pretty much and minus some docs about non-free stuff afaict https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNewSense#Versions
[2016-05-24 01:31:30 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] mutante, if I installed gNewSense and came here for support, would I be laughed out of the room?
[2016-05-24 01:31:38 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] #gnewsense has 22 users
[2016-05-24 01:32:13 -0500] [mutante in #debian] notadrop: i'm afraid it would be an issue yea,  maybe #fsf ?
[2016-05-24 01:32:36 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] mutante, okay, but nobody there uses it :/
[2016-05-24 01:32:41 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] I think I'll go with GuixSD
[2016-05-24 01:32:46 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] why not go full GNU?
[2016-05-24 01:33:10 -0500] [mutante in #debian] notadrop: Debian GNU/Hurd ?;p
[2016-05-24 01:33:38 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] mutante, that is the goal eventually :D
[2016-05-24 01:33:43 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] oh wait
[2016-05-24 01:33:48 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] I meant Guix GNU/Hurd
[2016-05-24 01:34:01 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] mutante, I wonder if Hurd even supports my hardware
[2016-05-24 01:34:15 -0500] [mutante in #debian] notadrop: i ask about it about once every 2 years for fun
[2016-05-24 01:34:18 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] heh
[2016-05-24 01:34:25 -0500] [mutante in #debian] similar to using coreboot
[2016-05-24 01:34:35 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] I use the Libre fork of coreboot, #libreboot
[2016-05-24 01:34:53 -0500] [mutante in #debian] oh, nice
[2016-05-24 01:34:59 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] 100% FOSS running on this machine, except for CPU microcode courtesy of Intel
[2016-05-24 01:35:03 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] no nonfree firmware
[2016-05-24 01:35:06 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] or software.
[2016-05-24 01:37:47 -0500] [themill in #debian] except for the firmware that's already on every single chip
[2016-05-24 01:41:33 -0500] [neoncortex in #debian] hey, someone tell to the xombrero package maintainer to add gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad as dependecy, please, i have lost hours to discover why youtube was without audio because this -.-
[2016-05-24 01:42:05 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] themill, Libreboot is a replacement for the system firmware
[2016-05-24 01:42:57 -0500] [mutante in #debian] neoncortex: maybe type "reportbug" , select the xombrero package, paste that line in there
[2016-05-24 01:43:38 -0500] [themill in #debian] notadrop: there's firmware on just about every non-trivial chip in your machine including video, sata, usb controller, network controller, ..., you just don't see it from userspace or kernel space. Doesn't mean it's not there though.
[2016-05-24 01:43:57 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] themill, yeah
[2016-05-24 01:44:02 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] unfortunately
[2016-05-24 01:44:18 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] this is better than a locked down new computer, though
[2016-05-24 01:44:18 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] progress is better than nothing
[2016-05-24 01:44:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] it's not progress, it's false hope
[2016-05-24 01:44:50 -0500] [neoncortex in #debian] mutante: oh, cool
[2016-05-24 01:47:36 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] jelly, okay, you stick with that attitude
[2016-05-24 01:47:48 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] we'll see whose attitude gets the free software movement further...
[2016-05-24 01:48:11 -0500] [themill in #debian] no, pretending that you don't have firmware because you're not loading it from userspace does nothing
[2016-05-24 01:48:21 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] well, okay, I do have firmware
[2016-05-24 01:48:51 -0500] [themill in #debian] all it does is encourage manufacturers to go back to the bad old days where you had to flash firmware in a potentially brick-making manner and it was a big deal to upgrade firmware.
[2016-05-24 01:49:09 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] themill, does RMS's computer have entirely free firmware?
[2016-05-24 01:49:15 -0500] [sumi in #debian] hello
[2016-05-24 01:49:21 -0500] [themill in #debian] unless he's been making his own silicon, no.
[2016-05-24 01:49:29 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] well
[2016-05-24 01:49:43 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] I rest my case
[2016-05-24 01:49:57 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] if I'm not *hardcore* enough then neither is he
[2016-05-24 01:50:55 -0500] [themill in #debian] so that's my point, stop trying to pretend you're a hero. You've got a box and it's running stuff just like everyone else
[2016-05-24 01:51:39 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] fair enough.
[2016-05-24 01:52:46 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] personally, I think the more of the system that is FOSS and able to be modified by the user, the better. false hope? maybe.
[2016-05-24 01:52:58 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] FOS S/H
[2016-05-24 01:53:26 -0500] [notadrop in #debian] you're right, though. FOSS is nice, but we need FOSH
[2016-05-24 02:16:21 -0500] [thekrynn_ in #debian] anyone know why screen creation times tend to change ever so slightly when invoking screen -ls
[2016-05-24 02:19:25 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] I couldn't say that they do
[2016-05-24 02:41:48 -0500] [jim in #debian] can someone help me set up a oackage proxy (at minimum, a link describing it)... I want to be able to suggest it to people installing linux so they don't have to download packages twice
[2016-05-24 02:43:37 -0500] [jim in #debian] I'll check on oftc
[2016-05-24 02:52:26 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] jim, why'd they download packages twice?
[2016-05-24 02:52:34 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] oh well... then on oftc
[2016-05-24 02:59:18 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] i'm on the pretty blue install screen for debian 8
[2016-05-24 02:59:24 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] on the usb stick
[2016-05-24 02:59:37 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] but when i do the installation it freaks out and wants a cd-rom
[2016-05-24 02:59:54 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] is debian 8 not able to be installed from a usb?
[2016-05-24 03:00:09 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] chalcedony: of course it is
[2016-05-24 03:00:19 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] fireba11, ty for replying
[2016-05-24 03:00:27 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] what do i need to do to make it do that?
[2016-05-24 03:00:32 -0500] [babilen in #debian] How did you write the image to the USB stick?
[2016-05-24 03:00:50 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] babilen, with Rufus on my windows 7 laptop.
[2016-05-24 03:01:26 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/ch04s03.html.en
[2016-05-24 03:01:28 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] it all looked pretty good until i got past 'keyboard'
[2016-05-24 03:01:31 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] chalcedony: that works fine too :-D
[2016-05-24 03:01:51 -0500] [babilen in #debian] chalcedony: Hmm, no experiences with this, but I know that some tools (such as unetbootin) break the installer. On Windows we generally recommend win32diskimagner
[2016-05-24 03:02:08 -0500] [babilen in #debian] http://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/
[2016-05-24 03:02:15 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] chalcedony: rufus works i'm using it myself. (netinstall image)
[2016-05-24 03:02:24 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] fireba11, ok then that's not it
[2016-05-24 03:02:49 -0500] [babilen in #debian] It might still be worth a try (usb sticks are different)
[2016-05-24 03:03:15 -0500] [babilen in #debian] I mean it would, at least, allow us to rule out that
[2016-05-24 03:04:58 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] fireba11, yes that's what i have
[2016-05-24 03:05:17 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] the gigabyte board is new. should not have other problems
[2016-05-24 03:05:35 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] is the regular install likely to not see usb?
[2016-05-24 03:06:25 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] chalcedony: on a skylake boards that's a possibility
[2016-05-24 03:06:38 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] skylake?
[2016-05-24 03:06:51 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] newest isomething generation
[2016-05-24 03:06:56 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] ah
[2016-05-24 03:07:10 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] let me go find a dvd i guess
[2016-05-24 03:07:29 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] this worked before. it ought to work.
[2016-05-24 03:31:14 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Is anyone here familiar with the cryptsetup early ssh initramfs hooks?
[2016-05-24 03:31:57 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] It seems to be a fairly elegant solution to remote unlocking a server with full disk encryption in early boot.
[2016-05-24 03:34:00 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] But it involves the root user being active, which is mildly annoying. Though perhaps I could add locking the root password as a startup script and unlocking it as a reboot/shutdown script?
[2016-05-24 03:34:33 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] This is what I'm talking about by the way:
[2016-05-24 03:34:34 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] https://github.com/lhost/pkg-cryptsetup-debian/blob/master/debian/README.remote
[2016-05-24 03:47:55 -0500] [rudi_s in #debian] [Saint]: What do you mean with "But it involves the root user being active"?
[2016-05-24 03:48:46 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] rudi_s: sorry, that was unnecessarily vague stream-of-consciousness rambling wasn't it?
[2016-05-24 03:48:59 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I mean, it requires that I unlock my root password.
[2016-05-24 03:49:10 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] which I don't generally do.
[2016-05-24 03:49:47 -0500] [rudi_s in #debian] Still confused. The unlocking happens via ssh-key. How is "root" involved?
[2016-05-24 03:53:57 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] seems he's confused, not you
[2016-05-24 03:54:41 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] but maybe what he means is that he normally completely disables login for root from outside
[2016-05-24 03:55:17 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] which still doesn't have anything to do with this :-/
[2016-05-24 03:55:37 -0500] [rudi_s in #debian] True. You must use root@, but only to unlock the disk and it's not the same root than the one inside the system.
[2016-05-24 03:57:31 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] it's a nice idea...
[2016-05-24 03:57:42 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] still need someone to press the button after a power failure
[2016-05-24 03:58:22 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] and I wonder if it's worth the effort for the one time it may become relevant a year
[2016-05-24 03:58:25 -0500] [rudi_s in #debian] Unless the BIOS supports boot on power failure.
[2016-05-24 03:58:38 -0500] [rudi_s in #debian] But yeah, nice to have.
[2016-05-24 03:59:11 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] or wake on lan
[2016-05-24 03:59:24 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] which it probably does
[2016-05-24 03:59:56 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] haven't set that up, though
[2016-05-24 04:00:51 -0500] [telecity in #debian] [Saint]: yeah it ran the dropbear sshd
[2016-05-24 04:00:53 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] and you need root on a machine on the same net that is already on to send wake-on-lan, I think
[2016-05-24 04:01:18 -0500] [telecity in #debian] it involves encrypting the rootfs with cryptsetup/luks
[2016-05-24 04:01:49 -0500] [telecity in #debian] kernel starts, tries to launch init, rootfs being encrypted
[2016-05-24 04:03:11 -0500] [telecity in #debian] dropbear sshd spawns, you ssh into the box, luksOpen and the boot process continues
[2016-05-24 04:03:58 -0500] [telecity in #debian] i don't see any problem allowing root with PKI
[2016-05-24 04:04:31 -0500] [telecity in #debian] custom port, root with pki
[2016-05-24 04:04:44 -0500] [telecity in #debian] modify the login prompt as well
[2016-05-24 04:05:00 -0500] [telecity in #debian] use ECDSA
[2016-05-24 04:05:05 -0500] [telecity in #debian] what could go wrong?
[2016-05-24 04:05:54 -0500] [six86 in #debian] Anyone expert in installing/preseeding? I managed to get a uefi preseeded stick to installing, but a script called "60remove-live-packages" is removing the packages I install during preseed and also big parts of ubuntu...
[2016-05-24 04:05:58 -0500] [unborn in #debian] is it okay to install .deb file by just clicking on it? or shall I use dpkg -i *.deb command? I mean what is better or where is difference?
[2016-05-24 04:06:50 -0500] [telecity in #debian] [Saint]: https://kiza.eu/journal/entry/697
[2016-05-24 04:07:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] unborn: cli would always be better I suspect, but probably no difference
[2016-05-24 04:07:55 -0500] [telecity in #debian] unborn: as the UI is a wrapper over CLI, most likely
[2016-05-24 04:08:43 -0500] [unborn in #debian] thank you for explanation telecity im just about to install wifi driver but did not know if there is some special differences about the way how it installs it..
[2016-05-24 04:08:50 -0500] [telecity in #debian] unborn: so better support in CLI in terms of consistency in displaying err messages by default
[2016-05-24 04:09:04 -0500] [unborn in #debian] true
[2016-05-24 04:09:35 -0500] [telecity in #debian] unborn: like i said it's probably the same, unless there'd be bugs in the UI.. just that CLI might be more informative / more easy to debug
[2016-05-24 04:10:56 -0500] [telecity in #debian] six86: no expert at all, but you can disable the script?
[2016-05-24 04:11:54 -0500] [six86 in #debian] telecity: How. And where does it come from in the first place? I can't find it in the iso file. And after all, why is it uninstalling parts of the system?
[2016-05-24 04:12:21 -0500] [telecity in #debian] six86: how did you find out that it was responsible in the first plac?
[2016-05-24 04:12:22 -0500] [telecity in #debian] e*
[2016-05-24 04:13:20 -0500] [six86 in #debian] telecity: I can see it in de /var/log/installer/syslog file. Even after my late-command script there is a apt call that removes almost everything from the system. And above it is stated that the mentioned script is executed.

[2016-05-24 04:23:38 -0500] [JohnBalushy in #debian] I just installed debian jessie with the default gnome shell DE. It's not a necessity but I was just wondering is it usual that I don't have an option to turn on background transparency in the terminal?

[2016-05-24 04:24:58 -0500] [JohnBalushy in #debian] Under edit-Profile Preferences->Colors there is usually an option to turn off the transparent backgrounf.

[2016-05-24 05:05:56 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] Hi guys.
[2016-05-24 05:06:04 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] What's the proper way to make a service start at reboot?
[2016-05-24 05:06:30 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] My colleague has already defined the init.d script, systemd unit, and whatnot.
[2016-05-24 05:06:39 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] We're only missing one thing it seems.

[2016-05-24 05:13:38 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] k_sze[work]: a systemd unit file sounds right
[2016-05-24 05:15:04 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] k_sze[work]: the old way with init.d was running update-rc.d for it
[2016-05-24 05:15:25 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] hmm, maybe not the systemd unit file after all.
[2016-05-24 05:15:27 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] de nada :)
[2016-05-24 05:15:39 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] not 100% sure about systemd, haven't really used it yet
[2016-05-24 05:16:11 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] Aren't there hooks so that update-rc.d enables the systemd unit as well, while "systemctl enable" also has a hook to enable the init script in case you switch back?
[2016-05-24 05:16:55 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] Otherwise, update-rc.d and/or insserv for the init script (those confuse me a little bit), and "systemctl enable ..." for the systemd unit
[2016-05-24 05:17:39 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] in my exprience a systemd unit file is way simpler than an initd script
[2016-05-24 05:18:25 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] That's true, however I already have a skeleton init script I copy, so it is already easy enough :)
[2016-05-24 05:43:11 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] So if it's just an old-school init.d script, I should use update-rc.d?
[2016-05-24 05:47:53 -0500] [chalcedony in #debian] i can't get the realtek drivers to burn to the cd. the box won't see the usb

[2016-05-24 05:57:36 -0500] [FNTM-U3 in #debian] all and all it is good but I want to change the font of it. Yes the font. it is hard coded per say in the theme. I cant change it with lxappearance or ....
[2016-05-24 05:57:55 -0500] [FNTM-U3 in #debian] any software to use of the theme or what are the files I should be editing by hands?
[2016-05-24 06:10:51 -0500] [unborn in #debian] does gnome in debian use compiz?
[2016-05-24 06:15:53 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: nope, it uses mutter

[2016-05-24 06:22:51 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: hmm I dont think you need _any_ sw for recording the desktop
[2016-05-24 06:23:31 -0500] [unborn in #debian] teraflops: I do.. there is not natively build anything to record video and audio into one file
[2016-05-24 06:23:51 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: ffmpeg does it also gstreamer
[2016-05-24 06:24:13 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] you can grab the audio too of course
[2016-05-24 06:24:44 -0500] [unborn in #debian] teraflops: ah yes.. I tried those, quality was very low I mean image quality but perhaps I've done it wrong
[2016-05-24 06:24:45 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: there's like 1k examples on the internet
[2016-05-24 06:25:05 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: anyway I was just saying
[2016-05-24 06:29:10 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] unborn: e.g http://ix.io/KH6 I use gstreamer just for fun you can tune the quality playing with the quantizer options
[2016-05-24 06:32:12 -0500] [unborn in #debian] thank you teraflops I am going to try once netinstall finish.. heh if that works I will be happy
[2016-05-24 06:32:29 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] ;)
[2016-05-24 06:33:02 -0500] [unborn in #debian] gdm3 or lightdm? eh
[2016-05-24 06:33:26 -0500] [unborn in #debian] first time installing gui on debian :D
[2016-05-24 06:33:38 -0500] [six86 in #debian] removed my late-command file... Still no nano, man etc. Something goes wrong at the instalaltion here
[2016-05-24 06:34:26 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] lightdm sounds lighter (regarding deps), if youre going to install gnome then gdm is fine I suppose
[2016-05-24 06:34:31 -0500] [Rephlexie in #debian] unborn, I use light or slim personally, less deps
[2016-05-24 06:35:21 -0500] [unborn in #debian] im installing gnome and cinnamon so I can compare which would be better for my every day usage..
[2016-05-24 06:35:45 -0500] [unborn in #debian] so I am going to try gdm3 - I guess I can always re-install
[2016-05-24 06:39:31 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] six86: how did you install debian? expert mode? what options did you pick?

[2016-05-24 07:24:33 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] pressing f11 on the commandline won't do anything
[2016-05-24 07:24:46 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] do I need a window manager?
[2016-05-24 07:24:56 -0500] [unborn in #debian] okay strange.. I cannot add the printer.. seems to me that adding printer something crashes
[2016-05-24 07:28:56 -0500] [unborn in #debian] okay.. that happens only in cinnamon not on gnome so its all cool
[2016-05-24 07:30:40 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] AlexPortable: A window manager does help. What are you trying to achieve?
[2016-05-24 07:31:38 -0500] [six86 in #debian] I just don't get it... As soon as I use a preseed file my setup results in a crippled ubuntu server without "man" or "nano" or...
[2016-05-24 07:32:50 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] six86: Sounds like you should be asking in #ubuntu.
[2016-05-24 07:33:31 -0500] [six86 in #debian] petn-randall: I did. for 2 days, but seems like there's nobody around with knowledge of preseeding
[2016-05-24 07:33:48 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] shrugs.
[2016-05-24 07:34:50 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] six86: We can't help you with Ubuntu server in here. It's probably using different versions of tools, anyway.
[2016-05-24 07:35:32 -0500] [six86 in #debian] I think preseeding is pretty much the same in debian and ubuntu.
[2016-05-24 07:36:13 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] six86: not at all starting by the installer
[2016-05-24 07:36:18 -0500] [six86 in #debian] used this preseeding for 2 years so something must have changed... But I will keep asking in #ubuntu ...
[2016-05-24 07:36:28 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] six86: It's still off-topic in here, sorry.
[2016-05-24 07:42:12 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] six86: there used to be #ubuntu-server, not sure if that still exists, good luck

[2016-05-24 08:04:33 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] Hi, I have two hosts running Debian on the same WLAN, which can ping each other. However, with file sharing turned on, they do not show under nautlius' 'Browse Network'. How do I fix this?
[2016-05-24 08:05:40 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] Are there any options that do not involve using samba?
[2016-05-24 08:15:52 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: what do you type in nautilus? also, do you have gvfs-backends package installed?
[2016-05-24 08:18:15 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, I have base systems, nothing installled. I type nothing into nautilus, instead clicked 'Browse Network', on the places side panel. I am looking for the default GUI method to share files between linux hosts.
[2016-05-24 08:18:56 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] Click 'Browse Network', after enabling sharing in the gnome settings.
[2016-05-24 08:19:00 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: well you have gnome, haven't you?
[2016-05-24 08:19:11 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, yes.

[2016-05-24 08:19:58 -0500] [Eryn_1983_FL in #debian] for some reason i got two ips on my desktop here, and it is screwing with my puppet updates,
[2016-05-24 08:20:01 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, *I have nothing extra install, apart from the base system.
[2016-05-24 08:20:11 -0500] [Eryn_1983_FL in #debian] how i removed them?
[2016-05-24 08:20:43 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: heh gnome is not _base_ at all
[2016-05-24 08:21:37 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: tried typing in nautilus smb://servername(or the ip address)/share?
[2016-05-24 08:21:39 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] Aorious, Oh, *default install of the desktop stable iso.
[2016-05-24 08:22:03 -0500] [Eryn_1983_FL in #debian] ok
[2016-05-24 08:22:34 -0500] [Eryn_1983_FL in #debian] it seems that when i bring it down  then then ifup eth0 i get my static, but then i restart networking /etc/init.d/networking i get two ips,
[2016-05-24 08:22:38 -0500] [Eryn_1983_FL in #debian] for eth0.
[2016-05-24 08:22:41 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: also gvfs-backends package handles it for nautilus so check if you have it installed, idk if it gets installed by default with gnome
[2016-05-24 08:24:08 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: btw if you want name resolution in your lan avahi sounds like a good choice
[2016-05-24 08:24:51 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] lo
[2016-05-24 08:25:15 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, Will doing all of that give me 'network discovery'?
[2016-05-24 08:25:43 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Aorious: avahi? yes
[2016-05-24 08:27:17 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] frangor: que haces con una ipv6 andas en una vps? :P
[2016-05-24 08:27:29 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] ou yeah lets go!
[2016-05-24 08:29:42 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] xD
[2016-05-24 08:29:47 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] ando en el curro
[2016-05-24 08:29:54 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] me aburro, me tienen pelando patatas
[2016-05-24 08:30:06 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] jaja, a las 4 entro yo
[2016-05-24 08:30:08 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, gvfs-backends was installed already. smb://servername/share did not work, but smb://servername gave me a 'Windows shares on ..' folder. Now I will setup avahi.
[2016-05-24 08:36:43 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] teraflops, So does Gnome use smb by default, or would nfs also work?
[2016-05-24 08:38:17 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Aorious: apt-cache show gvfs-backends tells you what it supports. nfs is not one of them
[2016-05-24 08:41:41 -0500] [Serajewe1KS in #debian] i'm looking at this guide https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SoftwareRaidRoot and two things confuse me: (1) i don't see a /boot volume, (2) what's the purpose of the two 255MB partitions?
[2016-05-24 08:52:42 -0500] [Serajewe1KS in #debian] is the IDE1 #1 partition supposed to be /boot, even though it's not labeled that way in the screenshots?
[2016-05-24 08:52:57 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I'm trying to install teamviewer but I keep getting a dependency error on "libpng12-0"
[2016-05-24 08:53:04 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I already tried to add x86 as architecture on dpkg, apt-get install -f, apt-get update and upgrade but still no luck
[2016-05-24 08:53:10 -0500] [antzero in #debian] Should I add some repo to get that package?
[2016-05-24 08:53:43 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] antzero: install -f ? so the package is not from debian repos?
[2016-05-24 08:54:06 -0500] [antzero in #debian] It was advised by the teamviewer page
[2016-05-24 08:54:11 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] petn-randall: i'm trying to achieve a thin client with citrix

[2016-05-24 08:55:25 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] antzero: and from which os is the package? ubuntu?
[2016-05-24 08:56:41 -0500] [antzero in #debian] teraflops: How do I know that?
[2016-05-24 08:57:09 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] read from where you grabbed the package
[2016-05-24 08:58:20 -0500] [antzero in #debian] It's in jessie, too
[2016-05-24 08:59:08 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] teamviewer?
[2016-05-24 08:59:14 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I added jessie in sources.list and apparently it's installing it, is this a bad practice?
[2016-05-24 08:59:37 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] antzero: i have no idea of what are you doing to be honest
[2016-05-24 08:59:38 -0500] [antzero in #debian] (I'm on stretch)
[2016-05-24 09:00:04 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] antzero: this channel is or jessie support btw
[2016-05-24 09:00:11 -0500] [antzero in #debian] teraflops, I'm terribly at wording
[2016-05-24 09:01:07 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I fixed that, themill sorry for crossposting and for asking on the wrong channel
[2016-05-24 09:01:57 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I simply added jessie in sources.list and tried to install the missing dependecy, it worked but I was asking if this is a good practice (installing from jessie repos on stretch, compatibility issue or something like that)
[2016-05-24 09:02:17 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] antzero: not it's not a good practice at all
[2016-05-24 09:02:46 -0500] [antzero in #debian] What should I have done in this case, then?
[2016-05-24 09:04:31 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] well, I'm not you... but for sure mixing repos the way you did is not a good idea.
[2016-05-24 09:04:33 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] markbob, Okay, thanks!
[2016-05-24 09:04:33 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] markybob, Okay, thanks!
[2016-05-24 09:05:19 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I used that source only to install that missing dependency, then removed it

[2016-05-24 09:15:22 -0500] [Deep_Thought in #debian] Hi, is their an option to pass to 'service apache2 reload' to ask for the password of the key?
[2016-05-24 09:15:42 -0500] [Deep_Thought in #debian] Because actually when there is a password for the key and I use service apache2 reload, apache crash without any warnings
[2016-05-24 09:15:51 -0500] [Deep_Thought in #debian] I mean with ssl

[2016-05-24 09:21:06 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] Deep_Thought: An alternative is to feed the passphrase to Apache. You can do this with the SSLPassPhraseDialog option in your httpd.conf (or another file that it includes). When starting up, Apache will take the output of this script and use it as the passphrase for your SSL key.

[2016-05-24 09:40:04 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] Can I test on debian if one deb is installed?
[2016-05-24 09:40:35 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] AlexPortable: Then I'd definitely use a window manager.
[2016-05-24 09:40:38 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] you can search for it in synaptic
[2016-05-24 09:41:32 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] f0f4r: As in, test on the commandline? dpkg -l 'yourpackage', if there's a line that start with 'ii', it's installed.

[2016-05-24 09:43:52 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] oh, and uhm
[2016-05-24 09:44:14 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] I was thinking something like dpkg-query
[2016-05-24 09:44:28 -0500] [rozie in #debian] f0f4r: dpkg-query with parameters will work too

[2016-05-24 09:44:50 -0500] [simonlnu in #debian-offtopic] not really
[2016-05-24 09:45:10 -0500] [Delf in #debian-offtopic] Those are "logical" reasons. The "physical" reasons are different.
[2016-05-24 09:45:23 -0500] [simonlnu in #debian-offtopic] i don't get angry much anymore. i take things with a sense of humour.
[2016-05-24 09:45:53 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] f0f4r: same thing roughly .. but you'd still need something to manage the output I think ?
[2016-05-24 09:45:53 -0500] [simonlnu in #debian-offtopic] accidents like that for instance would make me laugh at myself.
[2016-05-24 09:46:40 -0500] [themill in #debian] !installed test
[2016-05-24 09:46:41 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] To test in a script if a package is installed, you can: if dpkg -l $package 2>/dev/null | grep -q ^.i; then echo yes; fi   or   if [[ $(dpkg-query -f'${Status}' --show $package 2>/dev/null) = *\ installed ]]; then echo yes; fi.  Note that "installed" isn't a simple concept -- is the package configured yet? is it actually scheduled for removal?  See man dpkg "package states" and "selection states" for more details.
[2016-05-24 09:46:53 -0500] [themill in #debian] (note that ii is the wrong thing to test for)
[2016-05-24 09:47:15 -0500] [Delf in #debian-offtopic] Humor… seems to be a way to cope with… "stupid".
[2016-05-24 09:48:23 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] themill: I was aware of other package states, but I didn't know of /.i/ also being "installed".
[2016-05-24 09:49:13 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] But man dpkg-query explains that quite nicely. Learnt something new. Thanks themill.
[2016-05-24 09:49:27 -0500] [themill in #debian] the first character is the "desired" state and that can quite reasonably be h for hold
[2016-05-24 09:49:44 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Why would grub load windows without showing any boot choice first?

[2016-05-24 09:50:10 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] I'm booting off the Debian Live image, but after "loading grub" it just loads windows. On an Eee PC. What's going on?
