[2016-05-15 20:49:58 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] Arthur_D: or you can calculate it
[2016-05-15 20:50:17 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] just set all 1 where netmask is zero
[2016-05-15 20:53:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] JustinHitla: btw i find your nick offensive. if i were you i'd change it. you're going on /ignore because i don't need that
