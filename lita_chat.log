[2016-05-11 22:58:30 -0500] [deb in #kamaoo] google "wtf"
[2016-05-11 22:58:41 -0500] [deb in #kamaoo] help google 
[2016-05-11 22:58:51 -0500] [deb in #kamaoo] help 
[2016-05-11 23:11:01 -0500] [themill in #debian] yes, found that
[2016-05-11 23:11:49 -0500] [ipatrol in #debian] themill: where did I mention it's name before?
[2016-05-11 23:11:57 -0500] [themill in #debian] the version string was enough ;)
[2016-05-11 23:12:08 -0500] [ipatrol in #debian] oh, you googled it?
[2016-05-11 23:13:26 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] the moon is very orange here tonight
[2016-05-11 23:14:25 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] pretty cool.
[2016-05-11 23:17:11 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] did you have a decent dinner ?
[2016-05-11 23:18:51 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] every so often, or at least once the past 6 months.  we had a orange moon.  i'm near the gulf coast about 2 hours away.
[2016-05-11 23:40:13 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] Hi
[2016-05-11 23:40:24 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] I just installed NFS on my server, mounted from windows
[2016-05-11 23:40:33 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] when i go in /var/www it's empty
[2016-05-11 23:40:42 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] but it's not empty on my debian
[2016-05-11 23:40:51 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] i think it's some permission issue
[2016-05-11 23:40:58 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] but i can't find how to fix it
[2016-05-11 23:41:00 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] any idea?
[2016-05-11 23:43:13 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Sheraf: any reason youw ant to use nfs if mounting from windows? Why not use samba?
[2016-05-11 23:43:56 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] i need performance
[2016-05-11 23:44:05 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] i was using sshfs before, but it's too slow
[2016-05-11 23:44:14 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] samba would probably faster, but NFS would probably be the best
[2016-05-11 23:44:16 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] samba is not sshfs
[2016-05-11 23:44:24 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] never said it was
[2016-05-11 23:44:34 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] why do you think nfs would be the best, if windows is the client, why not use a protpcol windows has natively?
[2016-05-11 23:45:10 -0500] [njs in #debian] I've successfully switched to from sshfs to samba when I needed faster transfers
[2016-05-11 23:45:20 -0500] [njs in #debian] ...and that was actually just linux-to-linux, it was just simpler than setting up nfs
[2016-05-11 23:46:06 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Anyways I'm unsure on how to configure a windows nfs client.
[2016-05-11 23:46:30 -0500] [prussian in #debian] it is
[2016-05-11 23:46:41 -0500] [prussian in #debian] I prefer CIFS over nfs
[2016-05-11 23:46:56 -0500] [prussian in #debian] less of a headache worring about unix perms too
[2016-05-11 23:47:12 -0500] [pyface in #debian] is there a relatively easy way to change the keymap, per application? im using xfce
[2016-05-11 23:47:23 -0500] [prussian in #debian] pyface: key map as in..
[2016-05-11 23:47:30 -0500] [prussian in #debian] like swapping a key with another?
[2016-05-11 23:47:37 -0500] [pyface in #debian] yeh, thats it
[2016-05-11 23:47:38 -0500] [prussian in #debian] like caps lock = control?
[2016-05-11 23:47:44 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] pyface: unsure if you can do per application, but you can probabaly put a button that can quickly switch for you, or use a keybinding
[2016-05-11 23:47:46 -0500] [pyface in #debian] like ( instead of 9
[2016-05-11 23:47:56 -0500] [prussian in #debian] ya
[2016-05-11 23:47:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] per application? no
[2016-05-11 23:48:02 -0500] [prussian in #debian] you can try Xmodmap
[2016-05-11 23:48:02 -0500] [pyface in #debian] or _ instead of -
[2016-05-11 23:48:13 -0500] [njs in #debian] pyface: I'm pretty sure X does not provide any way to do that, except maybe by having some program like your window manager track which window has focus and switch around the global keymap as you go
[2016-05-11 23:48:32 -0500] [pyface in #debian] ah mkay
[2016-05-11 23:48:35 -0500] [prussian in #debian] ya
[2016-05-11 23:48:36 -0500] [njs in #debian] I don't know of any window managers that have this feature, though, it's just the only way I can see that feature being possible to implement
[2016-05-11 23:48:37 -0500] [prussian in #debian] that too
[2016-05-11 23:48:59 -0500] [prussian in #debian] otherwise Xmodmap.
[2016-05-11 23:49:29 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] not sure if xmodmap would achive what was being asked, that only configures the modifiers
[2016-05-11 23:49:50 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Though sounds like you want sort of 'shift lock' key.
[2016-05-11 23:51:01 -0500] [pyface in #debian] ye pretty much. its for programming, really. im using pycharm but it seems to not have the amount of keymap customising that im after
[2016-05-11 23:55:47 -0500] [geetar in #debian] question: I am new to debian.  On an old Mac without a DVD drive, I was able to install MintPPC, which I understand is based on ubuntu which I think is based on debian. Can I convert this distribution to a straight debian install?
[2016-05-11 23:56:33 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] geetar, nope
[2016-05-11 23:56:56 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] geetar, ubuntu and debian used to share the same repos... that was years ago.. not anymore
[2016-05-11 23:57:15 -0500] [geetar in #debian] jml2, thanks
[2016-05-11 23:58:07 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] geetar, they share the same bug reports, but their repos/compiles differ...  they can differ in many ways -- even though it is the same upstream..
[2016-05-11 23:58:30 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] geetar, if you see a simple package (outside repo) meant for ubuntu that is also meant for debian, then you often won't have a problem..
[2016-05-11 23:59:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] geetar, (they share "some" same bug reports, between launchpad and debian reportbug..  it's mostly for ubuntu though)
[2016-05-12 00:01:11 -0500] [geetar in #debian] jml2, MintPPC did not recognize the wireless card in the emac.  I wanted to add that to the installed kernel.
[2016-05-12 00:02:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] geetar: ask #mintppc for support then
[2016-05-12 00:03:39 -0500] [geetar in #debian] markybob: will do, mintppc is a low traffic chat channel and I wanted to try debian.
[2016-05-12 00:03:53 -0500] [geetar in #debian] markybob, thanks
[2016-05-12 00:04:32 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] i'm trying samba
[2016-05-12 00:04:34 -0500] [Sheraf in #debian] it won't le met write
[2016-05-12 00:04:55 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i'm dealing with some error prone harddisks and my /var/log/kern.log is 20G. what mechanism should I use to keep it under control?
[2016-05-12 00:05:36 -0500] [trysten in #debian] the log files. the harddisks are being recovered.
[2016-05-12 00:06:30 -0500] [trysten in #debian] more specifically: i want to truncate my logs periodically. I would assume debian has a system for this, is it only logrotate?
[2016-05-12 00:07:51 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] !gm frangor 
[2016-05-12 00:07:53 -0500] [orome in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: Error: "gm" is not a valid command.
[2016-05-12 00:08:12 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] buenos dias deb 
[2016-05-12 00:08:41 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] como estas?
[2016-05-12 00:15:09 -0500] [dgriffi in #debian] does anyone here know anything about coreboot?
[2016-05-12 00:17:19 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: logrotate by default rotates weekly and keeps 4 weeks worth. for you to have 20G in kern.log...something's really fucked. read the log and find out what and fix it
[2016-05-12 00:17:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dgriffi, it's for people who want to do some cloud things
[2016-05-12 00:17:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dgriffi, and then there's the other people who want to muck around with their bios
[2016-05-12 00:17:58 -0500] [dgriffi in #debian] jml2: I'm just having a crappy time getting things working
[2016-05-12 00:17:58 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: my kern.log is 700K and kern.log.1 is 2.2M
[2016-05-12 00:18:13 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dgriffi, that's cuse you aint mucky
[2016-05-12 00:18:45 -0500] [trysten in #debian] markybob: yes, they are sata chip errors because i'm trying to recover failing harddrives. do you perhaps know of a way to stop issuing such errors tothe log file?
[2016-05-12 00:19:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no
[2016-05-12 00:19:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dgriffi, the term also  can be grub-coreboot
[2016-05-12 00:19:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dgriffi, it's becoming more and more obscure as a term on its own...
[2016-05-12 00:19:38 -0500] [dgriffi in #debian] jml2: huh?  I'm just trying to get coreboot+seabios working
[2016-05-12 00:22:34 -0500] [trysten in #debian] thank you very much for the info marky bob
[2016-05-12 00:23:22 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: this is linux generic enough to where you might want to try ##linux
[2016-05-12 00:27:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: know what..this might do it. sudo systemctl stop rsyslog.service
[2016-05-12 00:27:31 -0500] [trysten in #debian] hey that's not too bad of an idea
[2016-05-12 00:27:35 -0500] [trysten in #debian] good thinking
[2016-05-12 00:27:41 -0500] [hiya in #debian] how to create a cron job for script to execute with a command every 30 mins?
[2016-05-12 00:27:51 -0500] [hiya in #debian] the script is in the ~ folder
[2016-05-12 00:29:25 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: do you want to add it to /etc/crontab? do you have root? run it as root?
[2016-05-12 00:30:38 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian] hiya: or if not running as root, crontab -e -u foo
[2016-05-12 00:30:50 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, I need it to run a root otherwise it won't work, the problem is its "tc" command script for controlling bandwidth but since it is based on openvpn 's tun0 tc rules vanish when openvpn restarts so, I need it to do clear rules (via script) and apply rules (via script) again
[2016-05-12 00:31:41 -0500] [hiya in #debian] it has to happen every 30 mins so that even if KVM restarts owing to any issues it applies the rules again and any disorderly bandwidth management is only there for 30 mins
[2016-05-12 00:31:51 -0500] [hiya in #debian] if I set it for 15 mins, would it cause much load on system?
[2016-05-12 00:31:54 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: so sudo nano -w /etc/crontab and add "*/30 * * * * root /home/user/bin/foo" without quotes
[2016-05-12 00:33:07 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, but I run the script like ./clear.rules.sh
[2016-05-12 00:33:23 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: i don't really care. crontab will want the full path
[2016-05-12 00:33:31 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, but I run the script like ./add.rules.sh <para> <para> <para> <para>
[2016-05-12 00:33:43 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: so add the params after
[2016-05-12 00:34:00 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, but I need both rules? so I add two lines?
[2016-05-12 00:34:26 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, it I set it to do it every 30 mins vs 1 min | what is the difference on processor load?
[2016-05-12 00:34:28 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: i'd merge them into a single script. add whatever clear is to the start of add
[2016-05-12 00:36:40 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, does cron jobs bring CPU load?
[2016-05-12 00:37:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: depending on what the job does, sure.
[2016-05-12 00:37:51 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: worked?
[2016-05-12 00:40:02 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] cansado xD
[2016-05-12 00:40:04 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] y tu?
[2016-05-12 00:47:03 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian] hiya: wouldn't this be better in ifup.d or the like?
[2016-05-12 00:48:19 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian] hiya: if it's reapplying qos rules when the vpn connection is disconnected/reconnected
[2016-05-12 00:57:10 -0500] [hiya in #debian] rjsalts, Ok, I don't know how to do it though
[2016-05-12 01:03:16 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian] hiya: if you put a script in /etc/network/ifup.d it will be called with certain environment variables
[2016-05-12 01:03:23 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian] hiya: see man interfaces
[2016-05-12 01:04:32 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: whats the script name in your case? and where the script is located?
[2016-05-12 01:05:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] rjsalts: not that easy. that'll run for lo as well unless you do some bash magic to check
[2016-05-12 01:05:58 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: there is very small difference to run script on server and on personal machine but both will work.. if you give me name of the script with correct location I give you correct command, you just use for your crontab
[2016-05-12 01:06:14 -0500] [markybob in #debian] unborn: i already gave it to him
[2016-05-12 01:06:59 -0500] [unborn in #debian] morning markybob ah great :)
[2016-05-12 01:15:16 -0500] [hiya in #debian] unborn, rjsalts I have a script that manages tc command with parameters | so its ./clear.rules and then ./add.rules <para> <para> <para> <para>
[2016-05-12 01:18:40 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: what do you think was wrong with my answer exactly?
[2016-05-12 01:19:34 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hiya: https://paste.debian.net/683506/
[2016-05-12 01:23:24 -0500] [hiya in #debian] markybob, people are suggesting me ifup.d solution when the interface and off and back on, hence asking more, nothing else
[2016-05-12 01:26:52 -0500] [hmf in #debian] does debian currently support SGI MIPS (Fuel  & Tezro)
[2016-05-12 01:27:11 -0500] [hmf in #debian] the IP35 machines, fastest MIPS machines SGI released before giving up MIPS...
[2016-05-12 01:28:19 -0500] [hmf in #debian] I have an O2, which it supports, but those are really not the fastest
[2016-05-12 01:28:55 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hmf: https://www.debian.org/ports/mips/
[2016-05-12 01:33:53 -0500] [hmf in #debian] k I'm on a fuel (R16000).. the last/fastest workstation SGI made.. its not supported, so... is that Linux or debian ?
[2016-05-12 01:33:58 -0500] [hmf in #debian] probably the kernel
[2016-05-12 01:34:46 -0500] [hmf in #debian] yep, fuels and tezros (IP35 level machines) are not supported by linux
[2016-05-12 01:35:01 -0500] [hmf in #debian] everything supports the indys and o2s tho..
[2016-05-12 01:35:19 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: https://paste.debian.net/683507/
[2016-05-12 01:35:44 -0500] [hmf in #debian] I'm going to see about FreeBSD/MIPS.. oh - same deal...
[2016-05-12 01:36:10 -0500] [hmf in #debian] i have irix so i guess that's what im using
[2016-05-12 01:37:06 -0500] [unborn in #debian] that is simplest solution for you how to run cronjob.. if you need to run this as root then log into machine as root and crontab my-cronjob and paste it there
[2016-05-12 01:37:13 -0500] [hiya in #debian] unborn, why /dev/null ?
[2016-05-12 01:37:15 -0500] [hmf in #debian] or, i can patch the kernel with hw support for an IP35 system.. but I have absolutely 0-time for that.. which sucks because I'm a kernel developer for BSD, Linux and Solaris
[2016-05-12 01:37:38 -0500] [hiya in #debian] unborn, Also I got a lot of para for add-rules l
[2016-05-12 01:37:41 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: so output does not generate anything
[2016-05-12 01:38:03 -0500] [markybob in #debian] he's trying to stop output. but you said it needed to be root so you need to add root like what i said earlier
[2016-05-12 01:38:10 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: put them all into one script as I suggested into some-rule.sh
[2016-05-12 01:38:49 -0500] [unborn in #debian] markybob: it would be easier if he add this to roots crontab..
[2016-05-12 01:38:58 -0500] [markybob in #debian] that's what i said
[2016-05-12 01:39:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i said sudo -w /etc/crontab
[2016-05-12 01:39:12 -0500] [markybob in #debian] and gave him everything
[2016-05-12 01:39:21 -0500] [unborn in #debian] ah did not seen this markybob sorry
[2016-05-12 01:39:23 -0500] [markybob in #debian] and no one listens :( now i'm going on a smoke break
[2016-05-12 01:39:52 -0500] [unborn in #debian] markybob: yeah last night there was guy with pdo issue exactly same thing :D
[2016-05-12 01:40:04 -0500] [posi in #debian] anyone wanna make open source deb packages for my postgresql extension. happy to pay
[2016-05-12 01:40:26 -0500] [posi in #debian] github.com/posix4e/jsoncdc. it's already on pgxn
[2016-05-12 01:40:41 -0500] [posi in #debian] hooray money for open source
[2016-05-12 01:41:13 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: if you would like to see output every time you run that cronjob then remove /dev/null.....
[2016-05-12 01:43:05 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: to get logs that cronjob done its thing you can replace >/dev/null 2>&1 with >/some-folder/logfile-name.txt that will create text file with output (what you normally see when you run command in terminal) simple
[2016-05-12 01:49:13 -0500] [unborn in #debian] hiya: is it working for you?
[2016-05-12 01:51:36 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] hola
[2016-05-12 07:53:41 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] nadeem: check dmesg for clues
[2016-05-12 08:42:25 -0500] [Walex in #debian] DammitJim: you can set the DPI on different X11 'screens' and evenn on different monitors mapped to the same 'screen', but applications don't always care (actually, almost never)
[2016-05-12 08:42:25 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] ok, how do I do that per monitor?
[2016-05-12 08:42:27 -0500] [Walakea in #debian] but there is no way to see KDE 5 on jessie without issueas, right?
[2016-05-12 08:43:03 -0500] [Walex in #debian] DammitJim: 'man xrandr' => '--dpi'
[2016-05-12 08:43:20 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] Walex, that's what I used, but that does it for ALL monitors
[2016-05-12 08:50:31 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I was just trying to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid which happens 90% of the time
[2016-05-12 08:51:32 -0500] [Walex in #debian] DammitJim: you are trying to do something that should work, but the reason why usually it does not is usually complicated, but it all goes back to that Keith Packard guy and his moronic changes

This is *not* the same as compression, which is a separate operation.  Debian Archives is the repository for old Debian releases, see http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive .  For the package archive, ask me about <snapshot>.  Old Debian <ISO> files are archived at http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/

[2016-05-12 11:49:11 -0500] [spaceman in #bash] sjohnson: ok.  xargs i've never heard of before.  i'll look it up.
[2016-05-12 11:49:22 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught yes, I have no problem doing it
[2016-05-12 11:49:26 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] let me see
[2016-05-12 11:49:31 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops, me avente 3 scripts para lo de wordcloud con bot log xD
[2016-05-12 11:49:36 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] spaceman: you should also learn the risks associated with using it.
[2016-05-12 11:49:40 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] !xargs > spaceman
[2016-05-12 11:49:41 -0500] [greybot in #bash] spaceman: xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.
[2016-05-12 11:50:33 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] (the last part of that bot message leading to !faq 1)
[2016-05-12 11:50:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: also you mentioned qemu, are you launching qemu from the cli, or are you in some sort of virt-manager console?

[2016-05-12 11:51:17 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] digitalice, why aren´t you using a ModelChoiceField?
[2016-05-12 11:51:26 -0500] [ironbeard in #django] Does django take care of translating verbose_name and verbose_name_plural, or is it the onus of the coder to add _() to the Meta classes for every object even if the verbose name lines up with the class name?
[2016-05-12 11:51:36 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught you helped me setup what I have so far :)
[2016-05-12 11:51:42 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] styler2go: Then you want to bridge both interfaces. https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections
[2016-05-12 11:51:44 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] ironbeard, the latter
[2016-05-12 11:51:47 -0500] [digitalice in #django] WickedHangover, That form is not a ModelForm.
[2016-05-12 11:51:56 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught yesterday the problem was I downloaded arm64 image instead of amd64
[2016-05-12 11:52:03 -0500] [ironbeard in #django] Wietienkie: aww, boo :( Thanks!
[2016-05-12 11:52:08 -0500] [spaceman in #bash] sjohnson: yes interesting.  far far beyond what i know lol..  i just know single line stuff.  thnx tho
[2016-05-12 11:52:10 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] digitalice, so?
[2016-05-12 11:52:36 -0500] [spaceman in #bash] i don't have a good time with the 'find' command but i've never bothered to read the man page
[2016-05-12 11:52:45 -0500] [digitalice in #django] Wietienkie, I can's use a model form ...
[2016-05-12 11:52:46 -0500] [TheBard in ##windows] hubot__, it doesnt have a port of Putty, but it does have several SSH and hyperterminal apps

[2016-05-12 11:53:30 -0500] [styler2go in #debian] could you help me doing that or is it easy?
[2016-05-12 11:54:08 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught I'm choosing language English, country Brazil and keymap Brazilian
[2016-05-12 11:54:54 -0500] [hubot__ in ##windows] it=what? TheBard
[2016-05-12 11:54:58 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] digitalice, who says you need a model form for a ModelChoiceField?

[2016-05-12 11:56:10 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] styler2go: I don't know the methods for ipv6 yet, I would need to research.  I have true ipv6 from my provider but really haven't messed with it.  The lag is  a lot worse than my ipv4.
[2016-05-12 11:56:11 -0500] [digitalice in #django] Wietienkie, sorry, I've read bad ... mecause a ModelChoiceFieled runs the query every time a form is created.
[2016-05-12 11:56:35 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: no te hace falta ese sitio
[2016-05-12 11:56:37 -0500] [digitalice in #django] Wietienkie, If my formset is about 100 forms, it will generate 100 queries ... all the same ...
[2016-05-12 11:56:54 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] ah yes, I see what you´re getting at
[2016-05-12 11:57:05 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] give me a moment, I have workarounds for that, but it´s not pretty
[2016-05-12 11:57:11 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: en git esta la libreria en python que hace eso, hay mucha gente que la usa, en atchlinux esta pacgraph por ejemplo

[2016-05-12 11:59:31 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] Devastator: Does the error prevent the installer from completing?
[2016-05-12 11:59:48 -0500] [styler2go in #debian] petn-randall, brctl addif br0 wlan0 wlan1; can't add wlan0 to bridge br0: Operation not supported

[2016-05-12 12:00:13 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Hi guys, my makemigrations doesnt seem to update, How do I fix it?
[2016-05-12 12:00:17 -0500] [blind in #bash] Alma: I think you want "$#" not "$@"
[2016-05-12 12:00:21 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] I also tried makemigrations app_name
[2016-05-12 12:00:28 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] week... end... soon...
[2016-05-12 12:00:33 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] Devastator: It's possible it's a bad copy of the installer.
[2016-05-12 12:00:33 -0500] [blind in #bash] "$@" is an array of all the arguments passed in, "$#" is the count of arguments passed in
[2016-05-12 12:00:41 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] heh
[2016-05-12 12:00:41 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] Devastator: Did you verify the iso and the burn?
[2016-05-12 12:00:41 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] when I hit migrate, it shows me the error which I already fixed
[2016-05-12 12:01:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jhutchins I'm making qemu boot the iso directly and md5 matches, can it still be bad?

[2016-05-12 12:02:27 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] ahora usar esos datos y generar por ejemplo las palabras y generar el graph, de ahi subirlo a un web
[2016-05-12 12:02:28 -0500] [Alma in #bash] Would $# just count the amount of arguments but not the argument itself right?
[2016-05-12 12:02:32 -0500] [asd213 in #debian] guys, what's the best way to compile a kernel straight from upstream sources? make deb-pkg or make-kpkg?
[2016-05-12 12:02:43 -0500] [guideX in ##windows] hubot__: for windows phone, use https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/the-ssh-client/9wzdncrcwnwh
[2016-05-12 12:02:47 -0500] [Alma in #bash] I mean, if I wrote 1 3, it would spell option 1 2 because there are two arguments
[2016-05-12 12:02:50 -0500] [guideX in ##windows] I have used it on my 1520
[2016-05-12 12:03:06 -0500] [hubot__ in ##windows] yeah i found it also; not much good review for that app yet. guideX
[2016-05-12 12:03:09 -0500] [markybob in #debian] make deb-pkg per handbook. you should read it. make-kpkg is no longer supported

[2016-05-12 12:04:38 -0500] [Syslq in ##windows] merced, I mean too bad
[2016-05-12 12:04:39 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: te soprenderia de la de api keys que se pillan rebuscando por github :P

[2016-05-12 12:05:09 -0500] [Syslq in ##windows] I have been using androids since 2010 myself but I set up some crap on coworkers phone sometimes and windows UI is super
[2016-05-12 12:05:11 -0500] [merced in ##windows] i doubt they'll kill it
[2016-05-12 12:05:18 -0500] [markybob in #debian] asd213: read 4.5 and 4.6 http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html#s-kernel-org-package
[2016-05-12 12:05:19 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] so, for an actual formset instance, you can pass the queryset around to the formset, and let the formset pass it down to its forms
[2016-05-12 12:05:23 -0500] [merced in ##windows] i agree with that though, i love the ui

[2016-05-12 12:05:46 -0500] [styler2go in #debian] petn-randall, is it workign for wifi?
[2016-05-12 12:05:52 -0500] [Syslq in ##windows] merced, yeah, it's very logical, operation is painless

[2016-05-12 12:07:28 -0500] [guideX in ##windows] Syslq: it's quite large, however, my hands are also quite large, so no issue on the size.. just yeah, gotta avoid dropping on own head :P

[2016-05-12 12:11:08 -0500] [ghutzriop in #django] moldy, Wietienkie: well, looks like that isn't even helpful. the problem is, that I need the result from a tag as the keyword argument for another tag
[2016-05-12 12:11:13 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] Did anyone here combine django with react?
[2016-05-12 12:12:04 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] ghutzriop, that was not clear from your initial description
[2016-05-12 12:12:10 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] which tag do you need the result from?
[2016-05-12 12:12:14 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] mayur1: dpaste the traceback, please.
[2016-05-12 12:12:16 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] EpicMinecrafting, yes-ish
[2016-05-12 12:12:38 -0500] [asd213 in #debian] markybob. Ty. Found this: https://debian-handbook.info/browse/jessie/sect.kernel-compilation.html    Do you know what happens if I ommit LOCALVERSION?
[2016-05-12 12:12:38 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] Wietienkie: and with what results?
[2016-05-12 12:12:55 -0500] [ghutzriop in #django] Wietienkie, I thought I could cheat the problem, but apparently not
[2016-05-12 12:12:56 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] mayur1, koniiiik sounds to me like makemigrations created a migration setting the charfield length to 500 000, and when actually applying it, the database errors out
[2016-05-12 12:12:57 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] that's w hat SHE said?
[2016-05-12 12:13:16 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] jaja
[2016-05-12 12:13:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] she never did, actually...
[2016-05-12 12:13:34 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] x(
[2016-05-12 12:13:41 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: Yeah, and now when I change the value, it doesnt update
[2016-05-12 12:13:54 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] now the migration is either applied or not according to django (mysql? postgres? sqlite?), and makemigrations can or maybe can´t detect the changes, but you cannot run migrate even if it did because the db hits that previous faulty migration
[2016-05-12 12:14:29 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: its mysql
[2016-05-12 12:14:34 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I know a way you could find out what happens.
[2016-05-12 12:14:41 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] EpicMinecrafting, we´re using it in conjunction with JSPM and dropping all the static assets in a single staticfiles_dirs directory
[2016-05-12 12:14:44 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] Iridos no :(
[2016-05-12 12:15:03 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: I tried deleting the /migrations folder but still it doesnt reflect
[2016-05-12 12:15:04 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] so far I quite enjoy it, but the development workflow needed some heavy tweaking to make it bearable in terms of speed
[2016-05-12 12:15:09 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Wietienkie: Yes, that's what I'm guessing, but it's always better to see the actual error and not guess.
[2016-05-12 12:15:14 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] Wietienkie: jspm?
[2016-05-12 12:15:22 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] mayur1, _never_ ever delete hte migrations folder
[2016-05-12 12:15:39 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: I mean I didnt delete it , just renamed it
[2016-05-12 12:15:43 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] EpicMinecrafting, package manager around systemjs, sort of an equivalent/alternative to webpack
[2016-05-12 12:15:50 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] And what is slow, website?
[2016-05-12 12:15:53 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: I read a StackOverflow answer that fixed it
[2016-05-12 12:16:02 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] Hmm,why not npm?
[2016-05-12 12:16:07 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] sorry I asked
[2016-05-12 12:16:07 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] mayur1, can you list the migrations (I think manage.py showmigrations) and dpaste the output?
[2016-05-12 12:16:14 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] Devastator says Iridos says no
[2016-05-12 12:16:19 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] ah, the dreaded stackoverflow word has fallen :-)
[2016-05-12 12:16:49 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] EpicMinecrafting, npm for development tooling, jspm for actual dependency management (jspm would be equivalent of pip)
[2016-05-12 12:16:50 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught well, I've deleted the other vm and created a new one, unfortunately I'm remotely connected to my work computer which is then connected to the "vm server"

[2016-05-12 12:17:17 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] and slow in the sense that by default it loads all the imports via xhr when needed and transpiles on the fly
[2016-05-12 12:17:25 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] with React that has lots of imports, that´s quite slow
[2016-05-12 12:17:33 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: the appname is classifier
[2016-05-12 12:17:43 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] mayur1, which migration holds the change to 500 000 length?
[2016-05-12 12:17:48 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Heh, stackoverflow is the new Ubuntu forum – sudo this, remove /etc/that ...

[2016-05-12 12:18:17 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] mayur1, classifier/0001_initial?
[2016-05-12 12:18:25 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: yes
[2016-05-12 12:18:33 -0500] [Wietienkie in #django] dpaste the contents of that migration file please
[2016-05-12 12:18:52 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] Wietienkie: I renamed the migration folder, lemme reverse it
[2016-05-12 12:19:10 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] My favorite ones are things like sudo chmod 777 -R / ...

[2016-05-12 12:20:18 -0500] [lpapp in #pocoo] you share that opinion?

[2016-05-12 12:21:28 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] (am also Wietienkie, but on laptop)
[2016-05-12 12:21:34 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] koniiiik: surprisingly, it was the accepted answer
[2016-05-12 12:22:05 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: which migration made the charfield 500 000 max_length?
[2016-05-12 12:22:12 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Yeah, a green checkmark next to an answer is not a guarantee that it's correct...
[2016-05-12 12:22:32 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] it's like piping wget to bash...
[2016-05-12 12:22:48 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] It's just a guarantee that it made the problem go away for the OP, often by making things even worse without them realizing.
[2016-05-12 12:23:03 -0500] [mayur1 in #django]  xBBTx: I deleted the migrations table :( probably that migration is lost
[2016-05-12 12:23:16 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: your migrations are in python files, not in database
[2016-05-12 12:23:36 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] you know what, dpaste every single file in classifier/migrations for me
[2016-05-12 12:23:43 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] then I can maybe try to make some sense of the current situation
[2016-05-12 12:24:08 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] and while you're at it, I'd also like to see the current schema of your database for each table that starts with classifier_ as name
[2016-05-12 12:24:21 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] so I need to see which tables there are, and what columns they have
[2016-05-12 12:24:27 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: first one : https://dpaste.de/Ogk3
[2016-05-12 12:25:20 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: second: https://dpaste.de/Hksj
[2016-05-12 12:26:08 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: third: https://dpaste.de/Hms6
[2016-05-12 12:26:20 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: you can stop :-)
[2016-05-12 12:26:31 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: no sorry, not yet
[2016-05-12 12:26:36 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] that's 50 000 instead of 500 000
[2016-05-12 12:26:39 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: the next one is the one with 500,000 change
[2016-05-12 12:26:45 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] ok, show me that one
[2016-05-12 12:26:55 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] https://dpaste.de/2PAd
[2016-05-12 12:27:05 -0500] [lpapp in #pocoo] e.g. what is wrong about a confirmation email?
[2016-05-12 12:27:11 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] ok
[2016-05-12 12:27:45 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] now to be sure, show me your current database tables
[2016-05-12 12:28:11 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] either phpmyadmin screenshot or mysql shell screenshot, as long as I can see what the tables look like
[2016-05-12 12:28:19 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] https://dpaste.de/Sp0B
[2016-05-12 12:28:24 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] from that information I can try and puzzle together where the mismatch is
[2016-05-12 12:28:44 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: there are few more migrations after that
[2016-05-12 12:29:00 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] yeah, I saw that
[2016-05-12 12:29:20 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] I don't think they are relevant
[2016-05-12 12:29:34 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] mayur1: In any case, if it is at all possible, switch to Postgres – there at least if a migration fails, it will be rolled back instead of leaving your database schema halfway through a migration...
[2016-05-12 12:29:49 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: this is my inspectdb : https://dpaste.de/wQ7M
[2016-05-12 12:29:53 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] could have been an unlucture
[2016-05-12 12:29:55 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: you said you delete the django_migrations contents, is that showmigrations output in https://dpaste.de/TvWu still accurate?
[2016-05-12 12:30:29 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] if you look at the inspectdb output, it reflects the latest schema
[2016-05-12 12:30:30 -0500] [alayek in #bash] hi I need some help with Windows style file ending and Linux style file ending. Basically, I am running into some errors with copying a file from Windows to Linux environment within a vagrant box.
[2016-05-12 12:30:48 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Copying a file shouldn't cause a problem.  READING it might.
[2016-05-12 12:31:03 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] so that's where my db is currently stuck at
[2016-05-12 12:31:08 -0500] [alayek in #bash] I need to replace the Windows style line ending with Linux style, without using dos2unix
[2016-05-12 12:31:09 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] yes, that's clear
[2016-05-12 12:31:15 -0500] [alayek in #bash] Yeah, it's the ~/.bashrc
[2016-05-12 12:31:16 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Why can't you use dos2unix?
[2016-05-12 12:31:21 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] okay, I'll provide you some context first, and then we can try and go through the steps to fix it
[2016-05-12 12:31:38 -0500] [greycat in #bash] What else can't you use?
[2016-05-12 12:31:39 -0500] [alayek in #bash] I need it to execute and not error out like this: https://github.com/byteknacker/fcc-python-vagrant/issues/13
[2016-05-12 12:31:40 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: so that's why I said there are few more migrations after the 500,000 change
[2016-05-12 12:32:03 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mysql doesn't run schema migrations in a transaction (horrible design flaw imo)
[2016-05-12 12:32:09 -0500] [alayek in #bash] I was thinking more of a `sed` would do
[2016-05-12 12:32:30 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] alayek: what's wrong with dos2unix (as previously asked) ?
[2016-05-12 12:32:31 -0500] [greycat in #bash] I don't know what the hell dos2unix has to do with python, but...
[2016-05-12 12:32:31 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx, when I renamed the migrations folder, maybe the database was update, so the 500,000 error is gone, but the table is still the old one
[2016-05-12 12:32:32 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !cr
[2016-05-12 12:32:32 -0500] [greybot in #bash] Carriage Return (ASCII 13). Often represented by ^M or \r. CRs are found just before newlines in text files generated by DOS/Windows apps. You can see them with ''sed -n l''. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/052 to get rid of them.
[2016-05-12 12:32:34 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] the migration being run is entered into the django_migrations table, so that it's marked as executed, and the migration steps are executed
[2016-05-12 12:32:50 -0500] [Alma in #bash] Finally
[2016-05-12 12:32:51 -0500] [Alma in #bash] I made it work
[2016-05-12 12:33:08 -0500] [alayek in #bash] greycat: I don't want to install a utility on the vagrant box, just to help provision.
[2016-05-12 12:33:12 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] so basically renaming the migrations folder was a horrible idea
[2016-05-12 12:33:14 -0500] [greycat in #bash] *facepalm*
[2016-05-12 12:33:17 -0500] [alayek in #bash] If sed can do the job, I am all for it
[2016-05-12 12:33:21 -0500] [greycat in #bash] So vagrant is another !b29 right?
[2016-05-12 12:33:22 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mysql errored out when trying to alter that length to 500 000, but since that isn't run in a transaction, the insertion in the django_migrations table is not reverted
[2016-05-12 12:33:29 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Like docker?
[2016-05-12 12:33:33 -0500] [alayek in #bash] umm... not sure what's !b29
[2016-05-12 12:33:33 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] possibly.
[2016-05-12 12:33:36 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !b29
[2016-05-12 12:33:36 -0500] [greybot in #bash] It's always git. Or python virtualenv, or docker, puppet, ansible, or mysql. ALWAYS.
[2016-05-12 12:33:54 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBtx: if you look out the inspectdb, the 500,000 is altered
[2016-05-12 12:33:55 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] the error is gone, since django doesn't try to run that 500 000 change anymore, as it's marked as executed
[2016-05-12 12:33:59 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] but it isn't
[2016-05-12 12:34:13 -0500] [greycat in #bash] I'm guessing this url with -python in it was just your way of saying "command not found" or something.
[2016-05-12 12:34:23 -0500] [greycat in #bash] would've been shorter to type "command not found"
[2016-05-12 12:34:29 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: the error is gone too, the problem is changes after that are not reflected
[2016-05-12 12:34:32 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: inspectdb says 50 000, since that how the column is, because in the db it was never changed to 500 000, because mysql threw an error for that
[2016-05-12 12:34:32 -0500] [DELLtra in #debian-es] alguien que pueda orientarme con asterisk ?
[2016-05-12 12:34:39 -0500] [anddam in #pocoo] that was an odd interaction
[2016-05-12 12:34:48 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: stop talking for a bit and read what I write down
[2016-05-12 12:35:04 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: ok let me tell you this way :
[2016-05-12 12:35:07 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] your migrations and actual db state are out of sync, you first have to fix that
[2016-05-12 12:35:23 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: ok ok you go ahead :-x
[2016-05-12 12:35:25 -0500] [alayek in #bash] greycat: thanks for the Wiki link.
[2016-05-12 12:35:28 -0500] [anddam in #pocoo] oh nvm, houseprices you renamed, I read that is if left the channel
[2016-05-12 12:35:40 -0500] [anddam in #pocoo] houseprices: I'd say confirmation email are good
[2016-05-12 12:35:42 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] another question maybe first - which records did you remove from django_migrations? all of them?
[2016-05-12 12:35:53 -0500] [houseprices in #pocoo] thanks!
[2016-05-12 12:35:56 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] no
[2016-05-12 12:36:08 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] just the ones where appname = 'classifier'
[2016-05-12 12:36:15 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] rest are untouched
[2016-05-12 12:36:27 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] figured
[2016-05-12 12:36:39 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] and when you now run 'migrate', you get the 500 000 error?
[2016-05-12 12:36:40 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] !b25
[2016-05-12 12:36:40 -0500] [greybot in #bash] The newbie won't accept any answer that uses practical or standard tools.
[2016-05-12 12:36:44 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] guess you're not venturing a guess on the channel that stuff up there came from
[2016-05-12 12:36:53 -0500] [greycat in #bash] to be fair, sed is a fair answer to this
[2016-05-12 12:36:58 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Gah, poor writing.
[2016-05-12 12:37:42 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Still don't know what a vagrant is, other than a guy with no home and no job.
[2016-05-12 12:38:11 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] yes
[2016-05-12 12:38:30 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] does it have anything to do with manage=False
[2016-05-12 12:38:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] don't see it in #debian, so maybe #fsf?
[2016-05-12 12:38:41 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] no
[2016-05-12 12:39:13 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] nah... man, I tried to be obvious!
[2016-05-12 12:39:16 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] #debianfork
[2016-05-12 12:39:31 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] so, since you deleted those records from django_migrations, when migrating, django is trying to apply 0004_auto_20160512_1635
[2016-05-12 12:39:35 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] which is faulty and crashes
[2016-05-12 12:39:40 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] oh, right. forgot that exists.
[2016-05-12 12:40:36 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: if you change that migration to this: https://dpaste.de/cfWm#L18
[2016-05-12 12:40:40 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] bingo!
[2016-05-12 12:40:46 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] i changed the 500,000 to 50,000
[2016-05-12 12:40:47 -0500] [Alma in #bash] !!=
[2016-05-12 12:40:48 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] (change the CharField into a TextField in the migration)
[2016-05-12 12:40:56 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] that works too, yes :)
[2016-05-12 12:40:57 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] that fixed it
[2016-05-12 12:41:03 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] :-*
[2016-05-12 12:41:07 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] maybe even safer
[2016-05-12 12:41:22 -0500] [Alma in #bash] !expelliarmus
[2016-05-12 12:41:26 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Nobody ever tried to use Pascal <> here before.  You were the first one.
[2016-05-12 12:41:31 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] i like using dos2unix (or similar things) because they can handle other encodings where doing that might break something.
[2016-05-12 12:41:35 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] so what was my mistake here? so that i dont repeat it again
[2016-05-12 12:41:36 -0500] [greycat in #bash] So there was never a need to make a != factoid.
[2016-05-12 12:41:40 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] not quite sure how well sed would work on UTF-16.
[2016-05-12 12:42:07 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] maybe it'd work fine.
[2016-05-12 12:42:07 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] not knowing the actual database constraints I'd say, you should probably have gone with TextField from the start
[2016-05-12 12:42:38 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] other than that... bad luck?
[2016-05-12 12:42:48 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] mayur1: Really, CharField is not intended for strings longer than a couple hundred.
[2016-05-12 12:42:55 -0500] [Riviera in #bash] sjohnson: would you believe there are UTF-16 locales?
[2016-05-12 12:43:02 -0500] [mayur1 in #django] xBBTx: I didnt know charfield had a limit of 65k
[2016-05-12 12:43:13 -0500] [koala_man in #bash] I wouldn't believe that
[2016-05-12 12:43:15 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] mayur1: it's probably database dependent
[2016-05-12 12:43:23 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] which is why Django doesn't yell about it
[2016-05-12 12:43:27 -0500] [greycat in #bash] On unix-like systems?  Or on Windows?
[2016-05-12 12:43:55 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] sqlite for instance is the other way around - if you define a charfield with length 50, and save a model with a length of 55 for that field, it will store 55 characters
[2016-05-12 12:44:13 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] which is incredibly fun if you then migrate to real database... /s
[2016-05-12 12:44:47 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] xBBTx: If you want to index the column, the practical limit on mysql is less than 300 chars, IIRC, and it's a limit on the sum of the lengths of all varchar columns in the table.
[2016-05-12 12:44:52 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Eh, I meant mayur1.
[2016-05-12 12:44:53 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] i would believe it.
[2016-05-12 12:45:14 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] koniiiik: depends on which charset you use for the column... :(
[2016-05-12 12:45:19 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] mayur1: So it's really pretty much impossible for Django to give any reasonable warning, at least when it comes to mysql.
[2016-05-12 12:45:22 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Oh yes.
[2016-05-12 12:45:36 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] yo algo conozco de asterisk
[2016-05-12 12:45:42 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] so yeah, in short, I don't touch mysql unless there's really no way around it
[2016-05-12 12:46:22 -0500] [koala_man in #bash] any english text in utf-16 will contain a bunch of nul bytes
[2016-05-12 12:46:25 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] one of the most-wished-for tasks for a project we have is migrating an application from mysql to postgres
[2016-05-12 12:46:38 -0500] [xBBTx in #django] but try to get time and money for that from your client :/
[2016-05-12 12:47:26 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] there are utf-16 roman letters?

[2016-05-12 12:48:07 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] course.

[2016-05-12 12:48:22 -0500] [Alma in #bash] I have a very long variable with 6 (space) 6 a lot of them
[2016-05-12 12:48:23 -0500] [morphyeys in ##windows] how can I set the values of my text fields in an access form to be query results?
[2016-05-12 12:48:32 -0500] [koala_man in #bash] ff fe 66 00 6f 00 6f 00 62 00 61 00 72 00  in any case
[2016-05-12 12:48:48 -0500] [Alma in #bash] Which would be the ideal way to "if variable has any number character different than 6"
[2016-05-12 12:49:08 -0500] [greycat in #bash] if [[ $var = *[0-57-9]* ]]

[2016-05-12 12:50:08 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] actually got stuff done for once... AND could play with videos :P
[2016-05-12 12:50:11 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] like https://kaos.rz.uni-ulm.de/~k/movie.mpg
[2016-05-12 12:50:18 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] fun stuff
[2016-05-12 12:50:38 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] yey, productive days are the best days.
[2016-05-12 12:50:47 -0500] [Alma in #bash] it worked greycat
[2016-05-12 12:50:51 -0500] [Alma in #bash] thank youuuuu
[2016-05-12 12:50:58 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] not productive enough, though :(
[2016-05-12 12:51:03 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] oh well
[2016-05-12 12:51:13 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] still a lot of hours left
[2016-05-12 12:51:14 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] Hi all, I have a product model with users given permission to create, edit and delete but I want users to be able to edit or delete only products they created. How do I do this?
[2016-05-12 12:51:15 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] ... in this life
[2016-05-12 12:51:29 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] must be some kind of magic he only can do. yep. for sure.
[2016-05-12 12:52:00 -0500] [Alma in #bash] :O
[2016-05-12 12:52:02 -0500] [cnk in #django] babyswizz: Django doesn't do object level permissions by default, you will need an add on like guardian for this
[2016-05-12 12:52:03 -0500] [sol1x in #django] if i want to set cache control on an django restframework viewset, how would i do that properly? I saw, that these views inherit from djangos View class, so i could apply a decorator on the dispatch method, correct?
[2016-05-12 12:52:05 -0500] [Alma in #bash] Do I sense some jealousy?
[2016-05-12 12:52:13 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] what does this simulate?
[2016-05-12 12:52:27 -0500] [surfnturf_ in #django] babyswizz: or you could Fk each object to it's owner
[2016-05-12 12:52:31 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] that was actually my way of coming back to you because you didn't show you tried
[2016-05-12 12:53:00 -0500] [greycat in #bash] I'm totally happy that a clear, unambiguous question was asked.
[2016-05-12 12:53:11 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Didn't even need a web server.
[2016-05-12 12:53:31 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] do you usually do?
[2016-05-12 12:53:37 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !questions
[2016-05-12 12:53:38 -0500] [greybot in #bash] Ask questions. Don't just paste 200 lines of code on a web page and say "HERE MY KODE <URL> WHATZ RONG". Describe the problem, clearly and concisely. If necessary, give the SMALLEST sample code that demonstrates the problem.
[2016-05-12 12:53:42 -0500] [cnk in #django] sol1x: the main mention of caching in the DRF docs is in the throttling section
[2016-05-12 12:53:56 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] surfnturf_: what is FK and how do I do that?
[2016-05-12 12:54:01 -0500] [greycat in #bash] All the bloody damned time, yes.  https://hateful/javascript/page what's wrong
[2016-05-12 12:54:06 -0500] [surfnturf_ in #django] ForeignKey
[2016-05-12 12:54:23 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] I like that factoid :) Okay so you just mixed up server and browser, no big deal
[2016-05-12 12:54:26 -0500] [cnk in #django] that establishes ownership but does not do the permission checking
[2016-05-12 12:54:36 -0500] [sol1x in #django] cnk: thanks for the hint
[2016-05-12 12:54:41 -0500] [surfnturf_ in #django] you do the permission checking yourself
[2016-05-12 12:54:47 -0500] [greycat in #bash] The querent uses a web server to attempt to pass along his question.
[2016-05-12 12:54:58 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Because god knows typing english words here would take more effort.
[2016-05-12 12:54:58 -0500] [surfnturf_ in #django] for example, when you show lists of objects, you filter by owner
[2016-05-12 12:55:07 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] oh ok
[2016-05-12 12:55:25 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught I'm gonna start over now that I have a bit more knowledge, no backported kernel this time
[2016-05-12 12:55:32 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] point taken :)
[2016-05-12 12:55:35 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] Honestly, react or angular?
[2016-05-12 12:56:00 -0500] [cnk in #django] babyswizz: when I needed similar permissions, I went with the rules app. Liked it
[2016-05-12 12:56:07 -0500] [cnk in #django] EpicMinecrafting: react
[2016-05-12 12:56:52 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] geirha: can shbot's iconv eventually support Uniform Text File-16?
[2016-05-12 12:57:01 -0500] [sol1x in #django] can you elaborate on react/angular?
[2016-05-12 12:57:21 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] I don't think that's even wished for :/
[2016-05-12 12:57:31 -0500] [EpicMinecrafting in #django] sol1x: both are "frameworks"
[2016-05-12 12:57:36 -0500] [sol1x in #django] i started looking into angular, it has some nice features. On the other hand some things are really - weird
[2016-05-12 12:57:45 -0500] [greycat in #bash] # iconv -l
[2016-05-12 12:57:47 -0500] [shbot in #bash] greycat: The following list contains all the coded character sets known.  This does

[2016-05-12 12:57:48 -0500] [shbot in #bash] greycat: not necessarily mean that all combinations of these names can be used for
[2016-05-12 12:57:50 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] cnk: Please forgive my ignorance but what is rules app
[2016-05-12 12:57:51 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] By the way, any pointer to a bash script test framework of some kind? I'm writing one for work currently, but if something already exists, it would be nice
[2016-05-12 12:57:58 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] ah no conozco atersiknow
[2016-05-12 12:58:04 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] debe ser algun front end
[2016-05-12 12:58:06 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] trying to learn as much as I can lol
[2016-05-12 12:58:12 -0500] [trevor_s in ##windows] anyone know the best way to export all office 365 mailboxes to .pst files?

[2016-05-12 12:58:27 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] pero debe ser lo mismo
[2016-05-12 12:58:42 -0500] [babyswizz in #django] thanks

[2016-05-12 12:58:53 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] igual ahi explica bastante
[2016-05-12 12:59:33 -0500] [greycat in #bash] I don't know what makes iconv know how to use a given character set, but the list I get on Debian 8 is much, much larger than that list.

[2016-05-12 13:05:07 -0500] [Smither in #debian] Heya. Just installed debian on my laptop, and the trackpad doesn't work. I have done `xinput list` and the only mouse that shows is a "virtual core XTEST pointer". and when i do `cat /proc/bus/input/devices` I don't get anything remotely mouse/trackpad like. Haven't a clue where to go from here, any pointers would be fantastic.
[2016-05-12 13:05:08 -0500] [TheBard in ##windows]  <sepeck> trevor_s: ##windows-server
[2016-05-12 13:05:12 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] I guess that's a "no" then :)
[2016-05-12 13:05:15 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] but it was the only one that looked good!
[2016-05-12 13:05:35 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] set -x / bashdb maybe.
[2016-05-12 13:05:48 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see if you can find more info

[2016-05-12 13:06:08 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] uhm, I don't understand
[2016-05-12 13:06:11 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] just wait 15 years and... progress
[2016-05-12 13:06:16 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] well, different software
[2016-05-12 13:06:24 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: There are two common problems. 1) The kernel is not correctly identifying your trackpad device and thus not making it available to the os. 2) xorg is not correctly detecting the device.
[2016-05-12 13:06:30 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] the log will only check the second
[2016-05-12 13:07:09 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] ah
[2016-05-12 13:07:11 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-12 13:07:19 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] para grabar se usa mixmonitor
[2016-05-12 13:08:52 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Smither: which debian release is that btw?
[2016-05-12 13:09:01 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] ahora para hacer los reenvios no lo se
[2016-05-12 13:09:03 -0500] [Smither in #debian] somiaj: if i grep the log for "pad" or "syn" i don't get anything related to trackpads or mouse or pointer devices or anything
[2016-05-12 13:09:07 -0500] [Section1 in #debian-es] pero no debe ser complicado
[2016-05-12 13:09:20 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] jaja... I admit it... it's useless
[2016-05-12 13:09:25 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] but it looks nice!
[2016-05-12 13:10:01 -0500] [Smither in #debian] debian 8.4
[2016-05-12 13:10:09 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Hello
[2016-05-12 13:10:30 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Can someone help me find the cause of my computer crashing?
[2016-05-12 13:11:06 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] i think that's as close to a "testing framework" as you're going to get.
[2016-05-12 13:11:07 -0500] [compdoc in ##windows] could be many things
[2016-05-12 13:11:13 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] Hi, is there a generic way to make a simple __str__ for models? (I tried with json.dumps but I can't find how to limit the nesting)
[2016-05-12 13:11:40 -0500] [greycat in #bash] I don't see the connection myself.
[2016-05-12 13:12:18 -0500] [greycat in #bash] A more typical testing framework would be something like  for test in tests/*; do bash "$test"; rc=$?; case $rc in ... esac; done
[2016-05-12 13:12:39 -0500] [icelesstea in #bash] Camusensei: I've seen a bunch of people using this (although it's probably redundant and shit): https://github.com/sstephenson/bats
[2016-05-12 13:13:14 -0500] [S_SubZero in ##windows] that's not enough information.
[2016-05-12 13:13:22 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] po0dle: Do you have issues with power?; have you poured water in it?; have you eaten the DIMM?
[2016-05-12 13:13:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] it's all just balls in space. that's what everythin is made of.
[2016-05-12 13:13:38 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] ah, i see.
[2016-05-12 13:13:42 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] All of these things can cause a machine to crash
[2016-05-12 13:14:12 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] None of these things blkshp
[2016-05-12 13:14:12 -0500] [S_SubZero in ##windows] maybe in .be people can just walk up to other people like "hey can you help me" and the other person just "knows" the entire history of the issue and a 100% perfect resolution
[2016-05-12 13:14:13 -0500] [Alma in #bash] Can I split a line by using blank space as delimiters? I would like to show the output of df -h | grep /dev/ in a different way
[2016-05-12 13:14:15 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] looks nice, I can make use of that. Thanks icelesstea

[2016-05-12 13:14:47 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] po0dle: then do you think it maybe an idea to provide symptoms
[2016-05-12 13:14:55 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] yeah
[2016-05-12 13:15:04 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] the universe is pretty ballsy
[2016-05-12 13:15:16 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Maybe the people in .hu can ask questions or at least wait for me to explain
[2016-05-12 13:15:27 -0500] [snfgf in #bash] So, 'var=' returns 0 to the shell. So 'if a= ;' is true. So how can 'if a=$(notacommand)' ever be false, $(notacommand) doesn't produce any output so the conditional is equivalent to 'if a= ;'?
[2016-05-12 13:15:37 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Ok, it started after I upgraded to Win10
[2016-05-12 13:15:42 -0500] [snfgf in #bash] :S
[2016-05-12 13:16:05 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] po0dle: 4 minutes is long enoug to wait
[2016-05-12 13:16:08 -0500] [greycat in #bash] a=$(b) returns the exit status of b, not the assignment
[2016-05-12 13:16:13 -0500] [greycat in #bash] local a=$(b) DOES NOT.
[2016-05-12 13:16:23 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Welcome to bash.
[2016-05-12 13:16:35 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Well, there is no point explaining if there isn't going to be a response

[2016-05-12 13:16:38 -0500] [Unode in #bash] Hi everyone. I'm having a hard time finding the answer to this. Is it possible to run a process like OUTPUT=$(command) but in a way that I capture stdout to one variable and stderr to another?
[2016-05-12 13:16:42 -0500] [gl in #bash] # foo=$(notfound); printf '%d' $?

[2016-05-12 13:16:55 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] Camusensei: i misunderstood your question; my bad.
[2016-05-12 13:17:04 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] np
[2016-05-12 13:17:11 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Unode: No.  You need a temp file for one of them.
[2016-05-12 13:17:11 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Now that there is, I can continue :)
[2016-05-12 13:17:23 -0500] [Unode in #bash] greycat: ok, great, thanks
[2016-05-12 13:17:34 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] sepeck: can we block mhache for a bit
[2016-05-12 13:17:44 -0500] [cnk in #django] tuxayo: anything that involved json doesn't sound 'simple' - what do you want the output to be?
[2016-05-12 13:17:50 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] until connections work properly
[2016-05-12 13:17:55 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Basically I thought it only happened when I was gaming but I got it when just browsing the web aswell
[2016-05-12 13:18:09 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] Basically the screen goes to black, sound hangs
[2016-05-12 13:18:10 -0500] [S_SubZero in ##windows] ok guys just like we practiced, now that he's talking, everyone scramble!
[2016-05-12 13:18:42 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: sounds like it might be an issue with the kernel. Just to double check, you don't happen to have the touchpad turned off in the bios?
[2016-05-12 13:18:50 -0500] [merced in ##windows] scramble the jets
[2016-05-12 13:19:15 -0500] [Smither in #debian] let me check, but I'm 98% sure not. I haven't deliberately done that
[2016-05-12 13:19:18 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] mhache: hope thats fixed now
[2016-05-12 13:19:24 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] I described all the symptoms
[2016-05-12 13:19:24 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] does rather sound as if there's nothing coming from the kernel...
[2016-05-12 13:20:04 -0500] [talcite in #django] Is there a way to make django return an error when a non-existent element is accessed in a template? Ie I'm accessing things like label_tag in my form and the html renders no problem, but I try to access it in shell and it actually doesn't exist.
[2016-05-12 13:20:40 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] TEMPLATE_DEBUG setting, perhaps.
[2016-05-12 13:20:44 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] What I'm asking is, how do I narrow down the cause
[2016-05-12 13:20:46 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] Smither, you could do "cat /dev/input/mice" and then move around on it... IIRC any pointing device should be translated there
[2016-05-12 13:20:49 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] cnk, something like "id=1, attr1=foo, attr2='bar'" it's something that I also regularly need when playing with the RELP: having a simple way to see all the attributes of any object.
[2016-05-12 13:20:57 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] po0dle: Describe your system
[2016-05-12 13:21:16 -0500] [cnk in #django] let me guess, you are from Rails
[2016-05-12 13:21:25 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] What specifically blkshp ?
[2016-05-12 13:21:26 -0500] [cnk in #django] I totally miss ActiveRecord's output
[2016-05-12 13:21:36 -0500] [Smither in #debian] k I'l try that Iridos, also there is no option i can find in the bios to disable it
[2016-05-12 13:21:43 -0500] [cnk in #django] the closest I have come in python is pprint(obj.__dict__)
[2016-05-12 13:21:58 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] if a command fails in batch is there a way to output the error? I tried command >> file.log
[2016-05-12 13:22:07 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] It's a desktop, Windows 10 installed on an SSD
[2016-05-12 13:22:08 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] How old, what is it, laptop/desktop, CPU, memory, OS, Whats running when it happens, what have you done to it recently
[2016-05-12 13:22:25 -0500] [ScRaMbLe in ##windows] what
[2016-05-12 13:22:31 -0500] [po0dle in ##windows] It's about 1.5/2 years old
[2016-05-12 13:22:33 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] but it doesn't output an error when I run the way I want, but when I run the source bat file it outputs fine
[2016-05-12 13:22:40 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] tuxayo and cnk, it sounds to me like you're both looking for the admin docs.
[2016-05-12 13:22:42 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] it's almost like the commands just don't run
[2016-05-12 13:23:06 -0500] [cnk in #django] cause that helps in python shell how?
[2016-05-12 13:23:12 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] I guess not seeing it in xinput amounts to the same... still, only takes a couple of seconds
[2016-05-12 13:23:20 -0500] [gl in #bash] greycat: do you know if there's a reason why 'local' acts as a command? (and thus prevents the user to get the return code if it's on the same statement)
[2016-05-12 13:23:21 -0500] [Badrobot- in ##windows] maybe run as administrator
[2016-05-12 13:23:40 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Of course there's a reason.  "That's the way the code is written."
[2016-05-12 13:23:45 -0500] [cnk in #django] but enlighten me. what admin docs do you mean?
[2016-05-12 13:23:55 -0500] [Badrobot- in ##windows] put 'pause' at the end of the batch file to see what it's doing
[2016-05-12 13:24:04 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Are you asking "Is Chet going to change it some day?"  I don't know.
[2016-05-12 13:24:06 -0500] [Smither in #debian] Iridos: optical mouse does display in there, touchpad doesn't
[2016-05-12 13:24:21 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] Badrobot-, it's running silently through invoke process on TFS
[2016-05-12 13:24:23 -0500] [gl in #bash] i don't know what Chet is, actually
[2016-05-12 13:24:34 -0500] [greycat in #bash] It'll be tricky because POSIX is planning to include "local" in an upcoming edition of their spec, and that will dictate how the command has to work.
[2016-05-12 13:24:36 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] but I can try to run it as admin
[2016-05-12 13:24:43 -0500] [gl in #bash] oh, it's a guy
[2016-05-12 13:24:46 -0500] [gl in #bash] ha-ha.

[2016-05-12 13:25:04 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] Tells you every field for every installed app and model, and a whole lot more.
[2016-05-12 13:25:10 -0500] [gl in #bash] greycat: mh ok, thanks
[2016-05-12 13:25:15 -0500] [Smither in #debian] also if i ls /dev/input it shows only one mouse, mouse0, which is my optical mouse
[2016-05-12 13:25:21 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] Near inidispensible if you're unsure what you're working with.
[2016-05-12 13:25:52 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] although, truth be told, sometimes the easiest way is to just go look at the damn thing,

[2016-05-12 13:26:23 -0500] [Alma in #bash] available and used are the ones I found
[2016-05-12 13:26:27 -0500] [greycat in #bash] wait, *what*?  That isn't what it did in /msg.
[2016-05-12 13:26:57 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Alma: you mean on Linux?
[2016-05-12 13:27:03 -0500] [Alma in #bash] yes
[2016-05-12 13:27:21 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] tbaxter, actually I was looking how to make __str__ specifically for the admin. So the listing of a Model would give a comprehensive info.
[2016-05-12 13:27:31 -0500] [greycat in #bash] It's in the man page.  FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included.   Valid field  names  are:  'source',  'fstype', ....

[2016-05-12 13:28:38 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] And I'm looking for a way to not having to individually tune __str__ to get a basic overview of an object just by it's str
[2016-05-12 13:28:45 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] I

[2016-05-12 13:29:46 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] hubot__: Use a different search engine.
[2016-05-12 13:29:48 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] IMO, str is ONLY useful in the admin, and even then only when list_display doesn't feel worth it. I don't think an object should ever be referenced directly, triggering the use of str, in a template.

[2016-05-12 13:30:33 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Fine, ignore me.
[2016-05-12 13:30:39 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] tbaxter, I actually want to do this *only* for the admin
[2016-05-12 13:30:49 -0500] [greycat in #debian] What is the purpose of this question, exactly?
[2016-05-12 13:30:56 -0500] [CrowX- in #django] Is there a way to automatically mark them as seen, so I can only see them in the sent folder and not the inbox?
[2016-05-12 13:31:15 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] Smither, well... at this point it would be good to know the exact hardware so one can check if kernels support it and from what version on...
[2016-05-12 13:31:32 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] The repl part was because I have a similar need in other context
[2016-05-12 13:31:36 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] tuxayo: well, reread my answer there…
[2016-05-12 13:31:58 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] Smither, on the other hand, you could just try to install the newer kernel from backports and see if it supports it (see http://backports.debian.org/ )
[2016-05-12 13:32:23 -0500] [Smither in #debian] Iridos: Acer Aspire ES1-512 only about 1.5yrs old now
[2016-05-12 13:32:30 -0500] [Smither in #debian] and ok I'll try that
[2016-05-12 13:32:38 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] I meant of the touchpad stuff
[2016-05-12 13:33:35 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] most useful thing would be if lspci -nn shows it... (but can't see that on my laptop)

[2016-05-12 13:37:57 -0500] [marc_v92 in #django] Is there a way for me to customize the Django admin so that any time a certain model is referenced via ForeignKey, an additional button is added next to the Edit / Add icons beside the dropdown?
[2016-05-12 13:38:12 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] tbaxter, right I was confused, I thought that list_display was for choosing to call another function than __str__. I misunderstood "If you don’t set list_display, the admin site will display a single column that displays the __str__() "
[2016-05-12 13:38:35 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] marc_v92: for?
[2016-05-12 13:38:43 -0500] [Smither in #debian] somiaj: in lsusb there are a couple of things that don't say what they are... something from chicony electronics Co, and something from Lite-on Technology Corp
[2016-05-12 13:40:29 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] tbaxter, I read it too fast, list_display is definitely better than manually outputting thea attributes. Thanks a lot :)

[2016-05-12 13:41:31 -0500] [marc_v92 in #django] tbaxter: We have some specific guidelines that must be followed when people link objects to certain resources through the admin. I've created a page that has all this info on it, and I want to add a "?" icon to that spot in the admin that links to the page I've created.
[2016-05-12 13:41:59 -0500] [marc_v92 in #django] But only when a model has a ForeignKey to another model that falls into the scope of those guidelines.
[2016-05-12 13:42:03 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] marc_v92: I've added that sort of thing as help_text before
[2016-05-12 13:42:42 -0500] [marc_v92 in #django] tbaxter: The only issue with that is that I have to then manually add that to every model with the ForeignKey in it...that's a fairly large number, and the link may change.

[2016-05-12 13:43:55 -0500] [tuxayo in #django] cnk, I'll continue searching how to an object attrs because even if it turn out to not be what I needed for the admin, it would be interesting to know. Thanks for your help! :)
[2016-05-12 13:44:36 -0500] [rixi60 in #django] Hi guys, I have a Poll with participants where participants has a ForeignKey to the User model's phone_number field - would it be bad practice to set db_constraint to False to be able to invite users/phone_numbers which are not yet in the system?
[2016-05-12 13:44:36 -0500] [marc_v92 in #django] tbaxter: Hmm, that's not a bad idea. Didn't think of that. Before I resort to JS though, is there no built-in way to accomplish something like this in admin.py, or when the Model is defined?

[2016-05-12 13:46:18 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Are you saying you also have to *discover the name* of the file?  That it's not already in a variable?  If so, try something like file=(*)
[2016-05-12 13:46:25 -0500] [Alma in #bash] I solved, it was that blank space that  was bugging the command never mind

[2016-05-12 13:56:36 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] you asked for that :)
[2016-05-12 13:56:50 -0500] [Kadigan in ##windows] (there's an alt method bottom of page in case driver signing is a problem)
[2016-05-12 13:56:54 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] I don't see where you're using this Participant model at all
[2016-05-12 13:56:56 -0500] [jelly in #debian] she's barfed, Jim
[2016-05-12 13:57:10 -0500] [Kadigan in ##windows] ie. how to disable driver signature enforcement
[2016-05-12 13:57:13 -0500] [MarkX in ##windows] ah let me look at the alt method. i wouldn't get that red popup unless i was in "test mode" iirc
[2016-05-12 13:57:31 -0500] [Kadigan in ##windows] Unless of course You NEED driver signing to be working.
[2016-05-12 13:57:52 -0500] [Kadigan in ##windows] (in which case it's probably a gov job and You need to contact the manufacturer for an updated, signed driver :D)
[2016-05-12 13:58:01 -0500] [MarkX in ##windows] hmm i was trying to figure out an easy way.
[2016-05-12 13:58:19 -0500] [Kadigan in ##windows] Security is in-your-way by design and by principle. ;)
[2016-05-12 13:58:22 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: Does it work now?
[2016-05-12 13:59:06 -0500] [MarkX in ##windows] heh
[2016-05-12 13:59:11 -0500] [t4nk557 in #debian] Hello guys, i've a question, i've a huge file filled with proxy IP numbers. What do I need to type after sort to only keep the first IP that has the sames 3 first set of numbers ?
[2016-05-12 13:59:17 -0500] [DELLtra in #debian-es] alquien que configure una tarjeta sangoma a200
[2016-05-12 13:59:22 -0500] [MarkX in ##windows] i don't even know how i would include this in a release
[2016-05-12 13:59:38 -0500] [greycat in #debian] That sounds like a really bad question.  How do you know every network has a /24 netmask?
[2016-05-12 13:59:42 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] woot?
[2016-05-12 14:00:05 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] Thanks PaulePanter, I have this error again sh: connect to host MYIP port 9325: Connection refused
[2016-05-12 14:00:21 -0500] [rixi60 in #django] tbaxter: whenever a poll is created an SMS is sent to each user which are not yet in the system therefore i need the phonenumber stored on the Participant model - maybe i should just have a field which says phone_number and another which is FK to the user if a user exists whith that phone number
[2016-05-12 14:01:06 -0500] [t4nk557 in #debian] greycat: ?
[2016-05-12 14:01:09 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] Badrobot-, so the script is running as NETWORK SERVICE, I've given it full access to the files, and it runs as admin anyways I think
[2016-05-12 14:01:13 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: Are you sure, that ssh://git@myserver:9325/var/www/depotsGit/project.git/ is the correct syntax?
[2016-05-12 14:01:13 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] it will run xcopy
[2016-05-12 14:01:18 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] rixi60: probably.
[2016-05-12 14:01:23 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] but not the custom program
[2016-05-12 14:01:31 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] I think you've got the right general idea with a sorta through table.. one sec
[2016-05-12 14:01:35 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] doesn't echo anything
[2016-05-12 14:01:39 -0500] [t4nk557 in #debian] How would a dude that doesnt even know how to remove duplicate 3 set of number could do any tech harm lel
[2016-05-12 14:01:41 -0500] [greycat in #debian] t4nk557: the first three octets are not necessarily the network for any given IP.  Without knowing the netmask you cannot determine the network.
[2016-05-12 14:01:41 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] not even an error
[2016-05-12 14:01:47 -0500] [ExoUNX in ##windows] doesn't even seem to run the command
[2016-05-12 14:02:11 -0500] [t4nk557 in #debian] I'm fine with that, I'm just trying things
[2016-05-12 14:02:14 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] Yes PaulePanter , I'm sure beacause when I push with Netbeans, it's work true ... and same depots ...
[2016-05-12 14:03:21 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: `set :repo_url, 'ssh://git@example.com:30000/~/me/my_repo.git' from the documentation http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#
[2016-05-12 14:03:39 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: I would have expected a : after the port though.
[2016-05-12 14:04:04 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: On my laptop (decided to power it up), seems my touchpad uses the ps2 mousedriver (so the ps2 bus and unsure how to check that)
[2016-05-12 14:04:04 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: Try to set the port in `~/.ssh/config` and leave it out from the Capistrano configuration.
[2016-05-12 14:04:13 -0500] [tbaxter in #django] rixi60: my thoughts: http://dpaste.com/1H8HWM4
[2016-05-12 14:04:19 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: I was able to find the mouse mentioned in dmesg, and i'm using the module 'psmouse' for it.
[2016-05-12 14:04:21 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] debian894: man ssh_config
[2016-05-12 14:04:38 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Smither: I'm unsure about drivers for fancer touchpads (I just disable my touch pad and use a wireless mouse as I don't like touchpadS)
[2016-05-12 14:04:57 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] for some reason I wonder if that's the same guy who asked how to crack passwords the last time

[2016-05-12 14:05:44 -0500] [MarkX in ##windows] Kadigan, do you suggest maybe using the WinUSB Device drivers and having the device just show up as a composite device?

[2016-05-12 14:08:16 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] the flask doc pages dont give enough information
[2016-05-12 14:09:07 -0500] [rixi60 in #django] tbaxter: Thank's i will think a little further about it - i appreciate your input - your'e definitely right about the PK replacement, that was a mistake - but i need the uuid though to generate a link for the Poll
[2016-05-12 14:09:42 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] or homework, it's mighty specific
[2016-05-12 14:09:55 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] acmehendel: I didn't want to write an essay on Twisted, but I can help you right now. (As can #twisted.web if you have further questions.)
[2016-05-12 14:10:02 -0500] [rixi60 in #django] tbaxter: what do you mean by validation on the participant though? checking whether the phone_number/user exists?
[2016-05-12 14:10:13 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] ah, twisted.web
[2016-05-12 14:10:17 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] yo hay temporadas que tampoco

[2016-05-12 14:10:33 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] I didnt realize it would be so complicated though
[2016-05-12 14:10:35 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] uh dan sed

[2016-05-12 14:10:42 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] It shouldn't be. What have you tried so far?
[2016-05-12 14:10:47 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] gominolas o sugus :P
[2016-05-12 14:10:51 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] depende de la cantidad de sal que le eches
[2016-05-12 14:12:26 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] the following command:  twistd -n web --wsgi app_file.app   I keep getting wsgi not defined which I can understand but I have a line app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)
[2016-05-12 14:12:49 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] and the file is importing ProxyFix
[2016-05-12 14:13:08 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops: o las palomitas con azucar tb estan bien :)
[2016-05-12 14:13:19 -0500] [Ungy in #debian] if I screwed a package up and manually deleted some files and I only get errors from apt and dpkg tryign to remove the package How do I get rid of it completely so dpkg will redownload it and rinstall it without any fragmented crap?
[2016-05-12 14:13:44 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] PaulePanter, when I add ":" after the port, this connect on 22 port.
[2016-05-12 14:13:46 -0500] [greycat in #debian] What errors do you get when purging it with dpkg (not apt)?
[2016-05-12 14:14:06 -0500] [Ungy in #debian] it is looking for a file that doesn;t exist
[2016-05-12 14:14:10 -0500] [greycat in #debian] *what errors*
[2016-05-12 14:14:21 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] acmehendel: Let's double-check that your app is importable. Could you do this from a Python prompt: >>> from app_file import app; app
[2016-05-12 14:14:44 -0500] [Ungy in #debian] aha nevermind I got it found the last nasty fragment thanks for the help though
[2016-05-12 14:14:56 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] PaulePanter and I think mu SSH config is true, because I can connect with console " ssh git@myserver -p 9325 ". Juste Capistrano return error :/
[2016-05-12 14:15:11 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] it is
[2016-05-12 14:15:12 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] no errors
[2016-05-12 14:15:26 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] and it returns <Flask app_file'>
[2016-05-12 14:15:31 -0500] [greycat in #debian] debian894: the ssh_config suggestion was for you to put the port number in the ~/.ssh/config file so you don't have to enter it on the command line.
[2016-05-12 14:15:33 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] As hoped.
[2016-05-12 14:15:36 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] rather, app returns <Flask 'app_file'>
[2016-05-12 14:15:38 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] but yest
[2016-05-12 14:15:40 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] if [ $1 = 0]
[2016-05-12 14:15:47 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] I keep getting syntax errors
[2016-05-12 14:15:49 -0500] [greycat in #debian] That way the thing that is wrapping ssh for you doesn't have to know how to specify a port.
[2016-05-12 14:16:02 -0500] [greycat in #bash] There are two errors in that line.
[2016-05-12 14:16:10 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Unquoted parameter expansion, and missing space between arguments.
[2016-05-12 14:16:10 -0500] [KatsWhoSayNi in #bash] maybe you should stop guessing at syntax like you continue to do
[2016-05-12 14:16:11 -0500] [sjohnson in #bash] paul424: your space looks kind of cock-eyed to me.
[2016-05-12 14:16:20 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] Oh ok, thank grecat, I search make this
[2016-05-12 14:16:30 -0500] [FOX3 in ##windows] looking for a new operating system
[2016-05-12 14:16:36 -0500] [FOX3 in ##windows] linux preferably
[2016-05-12 14:16:45 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Okay. Could you pastebin your Twisted log? I need to know what the error message looks like so that I can go search for it.
[2016-05-12 14:16:49 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Something like https://bpaste.net/show/3c16bbc0f9f9
[2016-05-12 14:16:52 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Host whatever.domain.name
[2016-05-12 14:16:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian]     Port 23456
[2016-05-12 14:17:16 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] probably the wrong place for you then
[2016-05-12 14:17:42 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] I dont know that I have a twisted log
[2016-05-12 14:17:51 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] I'm launching it from the command line.
[2016-05-12 14:17:56 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] Hey
[2016-05-12 14:17:57 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] where would I search for the log?
[2016-05-12 14:18:00 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] hey guys, I had a small doubt. I searched around a lot on google and was not getting a satisfiable answer..... I am running a command through my bash script, How do I detect if the command I have executed is waiting for STDIN / input example: password prompt? Any help will be appreciated...
[2016-05-12 14:18:15 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Of course this only works if your wrapping-thing ("capistrano"?) invokes /usr/bin/ssh rather than implementing the protocol internally.
[2016-05-12 14:18:27 -0500] [greycat in #debian] But the odds are pretty good.
[2016-05-12 14:18:27 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] It should be spit out onto the command line, just like in that example.
[2016-05-12 14:18:46 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] capistrano - tool to execute commands in parallel on multiple servers
[2016-05-12 14:18:48 -0500] [greycat in #bash] You can't determine what some other process is waiting for.
[2016-05-12 14:19:05 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] written in ruby, of all things
[2016-05-12 14:19:08 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Gods, how many of those are there now?
[2016-05-12 14:19:09 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] ok.  that I have.
[2016-05-12 14:19:29 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] paynudes are seldom worth the price
[2016-05-12 14:19:36 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] this must be the... 6th one I heard of?
[2016-05-12 14:19:36 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] but the last two lines say self['root'] = wsgi.WSGIResource(reactor, pool, application)
[2016-05-12 14:19:42 -0500] [greycat in #bash] You could close stdin and see if it pukes. ;-)
[2016-05-12 14:19:42 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] well if the programs that didn't need stdin closed it then maybe we could have this possible but... not the case :)
[2016-05-12 14:19:45 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] maybe 7th?
[2016-05-12 14:19:46 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] then: NameError: name 'wsgi' is not defined
[2016-05-12 14:20:09 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Uh-oh.
[2016-05-12 14:20:30 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] yeah...
[2016-05-12 14:20:34 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] too, eurosong semifinals
[2016-05-12 14:20:35 -0500] [greycat in #debian] They're multiplying like text editors or desktop environments.
[2016-05-12 14:20:37 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] it's kind of good there are so many, because a lot of them are pretty crappy in some way
[2016-05-12 14:20:38 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] what's wrong in : return $1 * $(( silnia (($1 - 1)) ))
[2016-05-12 14:20:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] s/too/ooh/
[2016-05-12 14:20:40 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Which version of Twisted is this? It should be front and center in the log.
[2016-05-12 14:20:43 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] where silnia is a function
[2016-05-12 14:20:45 -0500] [debian894 in #debian] Thanks greycat & PaulePanter, I created ssh config file. I can connect with command, but no with Capistrano, same error :(
[2016-05-12 14:20:49 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Could you pastebin the entire log, with the traceback?
[2016-05-12 14:20:56 -0500] [greycat in #bash] return takes a single argument, not a series of random mathematical symbols
[2016-05-12 14:20:57 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] and cartoons after that.  /me found a new favorite channel
[2016-05-12 14:21:09 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] ahh thanks
[2016-05-12 14:21:09 -0500] [greycat in #bash] return $(( my stuff ))
[2016-05-12 14:21:12 -0500] [Camusensei in #bash] I love those questions
[2016-05-12 14:21:23 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] 16.1.1
[2016-05-12 14:21:35 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] I have a bunch of commands to run, I can't close STDIN
[2016-05-12 14:21:41 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Okay. So, I'm gonna try to reproduce this with the example application.
[2016-05-12 14:21:42 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] i can't test the water for each...
[2016-05-12 14:21:46 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Oh, silnia is a function name, not a variable?  Then you ALSO forgot to put $(...) around it.  Or something.
[2016-05-12 14:21:47 -0500] [NotAnNSAgent in ##windows] I'm willing to bet there is a "Billionaire Geek Edition" of Windows that has existed for many years and is like the normal Windows but without any junk and privacy-violating stuff. A separate branch, given far more care and robust like nothing else. And it's only available to really rich people.
[2016-05-12 14:22:04 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] for gods sake
[2016-05-12 14:22:06 -0500] [greycat in #bash] apsdoma: there is no way to determine what some other process is doing, not even when it's your child.
[2016-05-12 14:22:06 -0500] [NotAnNSAgent in ##windows] I wish I were running that.
[2016-05-12 14:22:10 -0500] [Gershwin in ##windows] how much are you willing to wager?
[2016-05-12 14:22:35 -0500] [Gershwin in ##windows] and which escrow service would you like to use for this bet?
[2016-05-12 14:22:37 -0500] [NotAnNSAgent in ##windows] Have no money to bet.
[2016-05-12 14:22:40 -0500] [apsdoma in #bash] @greycat: damn...
[2016-05-12 14:22:42 -0500] [greycat in #bash] $((...)) and $(...) are totally, completely different.  They have nothing in common at all except that they are both substitutions.
[2016-05-12 14:22:43 -0500] [merced in ##windows] the problem with that build of windows is
[2016-05-12 14:22:47 -0500] [NotAnNSAgent in ##windows] And you wouldn't be able to prove either way.
[2016-05-12 14:22:54 -0500] [Gershwin in ##windows] it's like court
[2016-05-12 14:22:57 -0500] [merced in ##windows] they steal your cc info and buy a redhat subscription per day
[2016-05-12 14:22:58 -0500] [Gershwin in ##windows] preponderance of the evidence
[2016-05-12 14:23:07 -0500] [NotAnNSAgent in ##windows] ?
[2016-05-12 14:23:13 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] I can't reproduce this with the example application: https://bpaste.net/show/e83704322561
[2016-05-12 14:23:19 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Can I see your traceback?
[2016-05-12 14:23:39 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] that looks kinda complicated... more like puppet or so
[2016-05-12 14:23:46 -0500] [Gershwin in ##windows] proof, in your sense, is not something used outside of mathematics and syllogistic logic
[2016-05-12 14:23:47 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Oh! Oh. Do you, by chance, have a module named 'wsgi' nearby?
[2016-05-12 14:24:12 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] I'm on python3.4
[2016-05-12 14:24:12 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] damm
[2016-05-12 14:24:32 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] no module named wsgi     ..... :/
[2016-05-12 14:24:59 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] Oh. Twisted isn't fully ported to Python 3. You can either join in the porting effort or use Python 2.
[2016-05-12 14:25:44 -0500] [simpson in #pocoo] twisted.web.wsgi is probably a module in hot demand for porting, but apparently it's not done yet. The Python 3 tarball automatically excludes unported modules.
[2016-05-12 14:26:31 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] ok, well that explains that
[2016-05-12 14:26:51 -0500] [CrowX- in #django] I am sending emails through email using django.core.mail.get_connection to select gmail's smtp servers. It works fine, however, the emails I send are unread in my gmail, so they appear in my inbox folder as well ass the sent folder.
[2016-05-12 14:26:52 -0500] [CrowX- in #django] Is there a way to automatically mark them as seen, so I can only see them in the sent folder and not the inbox?
[2016-05-12 14:26:58 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] that might explain why I cant get treq 
[2016-05-12 14:27:35 -0500] [acmehendel in #pocoo] or maybe not
[2016-05-12 14:28:29 -0500] [jcotton in ##windows] Has anyone in here with a windows phone gotten 14342?
[2016-05-12 14:30:08 -0500] [cnk in #django] CrowX-: I think you will have to do that with a filter on your email client. Django can't really control how things appear on the recieviing side of email
[2016-05-12 14:30:21 -0500] [jcotton in ##windows] Oh, just PC
[2016-05-12 14:30:22 -0500] [jcotton in ##windows] I'm dumb
[2016-05-12 14:30:25 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] debian894, did you read in /usr/share/doc/capistrano/README.md.gz ?

[2016-05-12 14:31:46 -0500] [Iridos in #debian] they explicitly set port in "Using password authentication" ... but no idea how that would go together with your config
[2016-05-12 14:32:09 -0500] [CrowX- in #django] cnk, isn't there some way for to use the connection to do something to the email I'm sending, so it appears as seen in the sent folder?
[2016-05-12 14:32:26 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] CrowX-: Depends -- what backend are you using? SMTP?
[2016-05-12 14:32:28 -0500] [sepeck in ##windows] NotAnNSAgent: stop doing that.  You aren't goign to get anymore warnings on the subject
[2016-05-12 14:32:30 -0500] [paul424 in #bash]         return $(( $1 * $(silnia $(( $1 - 1 )))  ))

[2016-05-12 14:32:49 -0500] [greycat in #bash] What is in $1, and what is the stdout of that silnia function?
[2016-05-12 14:33:16 -0500] [greycat in #bash] And what did it *do* instead of working?
[2016-05-12 14:33:20 -0500] [CrowX- in #django] koniiiik, I think so... I specify host, port, password, user, etc.

[2016-05-12 14:33:31 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] jelly, one of a kind
[2016-05-12 14:33:33 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] it's natural number and output is also a natural number
[2016-05-12 14:33:45 -0500] [greycat in #bash] And what is your intention with this complex mathematical crap that is supposed to generate an exit status?
[2016-05-12 14:33:48 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] it';s pol.ish for factorial
[2016-05-12 14:33:55 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !exit
[2016-05-12 14:33:55 -0500] [greybot in #bash] Every Unix process returns an exit status code to its parent. This is an unsigned 8-bit value, a number from 0 to 255 inclusive. Your script returns the exit status from the last command it executed, unless you specifically call "exit" with a value. Functions also return values, using "return".
[2016-05-12 14:34:01 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !faq return a

[2016-05-12 14:34:14 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Ah, okay; if you haven't changed EMAIL_BACKEND, then it's SMTP.
[2016-05-12 14:34:21 -0500] [greycat in #bash] !factorial

[2016-05-12 14:34:44 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] That's weird, though – gmail should treat that as outgoing email.
[2016-05-12 14:34:52 -0500] [xamua in #bash] swap bash and env...
[2016-05-12 14:35:02 -0500] [greycat in #bash] xamua: well, you're running it in a way that it has no terminal

[2016-05-12 14:35:37 -0500] [koniiiik in #django] Perhaps it might be possible to add a header that would set gmail's flags, but not sure...
[2016-05-12 14:35:45 -0500] [geirha in #bash] your function doesn't output anything

[2016-05-12 14:36:04 -0500] [greycat in #bash] That would be a great example of an env that has no terminal.
[2016-05-12 14:36:05 -0500] [xamua in #bash] I got ya

[2016-05-12 14:36:41 -0500] [greycat in #bash] Easy enough to understand since bash makes this incredibly weird.

[2016-05-12 14:37:02 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops, como subes imagenes a ptpb.pw ?
[2016-05-12 14:37:12 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] ok. But i saw some user with it in #freenode.
[2016-05-12 14:37:21 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] probably the same one!
[2016-05-12 14:37:29 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] did you ask him for free nudes?
[2016-05-12 14:37:38 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] you do that!

[2016-05-12 14:38:01 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] my best guess is, it's someone from freenode staff who lost a bet
[2016-05-12 14:38:02 -0500] [paul424 in #bash] aha what is output in bash ?
[2016-05-12 14:38:16 -0500] [geirha in #bash] printf '%d\n' "$(( $1 * $(silnia $(( $1 - 1 )))  ))"

[2016-05-12 14:38:45 -0500] [greycat in #bash] even echo would work since these are just integers
[2016-05-12 14:38:49 -0500] [nchambers in #bash] \o/ Just got to explain to another coworker why cat $file | grep 'foo' is bad :D
[2016-05-12 14:38:50 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] Does it matter why ? I think if staff would not like it. Certainly they will not allow it-
[2016-05-12 14:38:53 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] .
[2016-05-12 14:38:54 -0500] [greycat in #bash] printf is of course safer in the general case
[2016-05-12 14:38:54 -0500] [nchambers in #bash] another one bites the dust
[2016-05-12 14:39:24 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] xD
[2016-05-12 14:39:31 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] well, sure it matters... there's probably a funny story behind that
[2016-05-12 14:39:45 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] and if not, we can put funny speculation in front of it
[2016-05-12 14:39:56 -0500] [greycat in #bash] recursive factorial is the worst way to do factorial, especially if you're doing it with functions-that-write-to-stdout in bash, where every function call is a fork().

[2016-05-12 14:46:14 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] que diga: el modem del internet se ecuentra a 5 metros del computador en direccion suroeste
[2016-05-12 14:46:16 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] o algo asi
[2016-05-12 14:46:27 -0500] [solidvance in #django] turn off send copies to you?
[2016-05-12 14:46:52 -0500] [solidvance in #django] there should be no reason they're ending up in your inbox unless something like that is enabled
[2016-05-12 14:46:57 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops: pense que te quejabas porque usaba software privativo como servidor web o algo asi, se me ha ido la olla.. como netcat suena similar a tomcat que si es un servidor de aplicaciones xD
[2016-05-12 14:47:14 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] se que suena raro
[2016-05-12 14:47:16 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] pero el problema
[2016-05-12 14:47:37 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] es que hay un modem dentro de la estructura del edificio donde trabajo que no se sabe donde se encuentra con exactitud
[2016-05-12 14:47:39 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: muy mal por no añadirme, siento celos de vosotros dos.. :(
[2016-05-12 14:47:39 -0500] [kal_cividFajdida in #debian-es] asimoviano: lo dudo. Si estas conectado por un proveedor, te asigna una ip y saldra el lugar donde esta el servidor dns del proveedor, p. ej, , el mio sale en otra ciudad a 150 km de mi.
[2016-05-12 14:48:05 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] kal_cividFajdida: me refiero en una red local
[2016-05-12 14:48:11 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] deb y teraflops ahi con el mismo color..
[2016-05-12 14:48:20 -0500] [kal_cividFajdida in #debian-es] ahh vale.
[2016-05-12 14:48:22 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] algo que diga: el equipo con la ip 10.0.0.1 esta en tal sitio
[2016-05-12 14:48:29 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] a tal distancia
[2016-05-12 14:48:32 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] en tal direccion
[2016-05-12 14:48:34 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] o algo mejor
[2016-05-12 14:48:35 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] :D
[2016-05-12 14:48:52 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] jaja
[2016-05-12 14:48:55 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] no hablas
[2016-05-12 14:49:05 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] deja saco uno de este canal en especifico
[2016-05-12 14:49:07 -0500] [greycat in #debian] They can't both share the same IMAP listening port, that's for sure.
[2016-05-12 14:49:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] SerajewelKS: never tried anything that silly, just local mutt + dovecot
[2016-05-12 14:49:15 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] just copy their website, replace all technical terms with the word 'boobs', add some pictures. done!
[2016-05-12 14:49:32 -0500] [jelly in #debian] mutt tampering with Maildir directly, that is
[2016-05-12 14:49:36 -0500] [kal_cividFajdida in #debian-es] hay un cmd que te dice la ruta del recorrido de una señal que envies, pero no te dice en que piso esta.
[2016-05-12 14:49:40 -0500] [Stryyker in ##windows] larryba: If you find entries in event viewer as suitable triggers then they can be used for task triggers.
[2016-05-12 14:49:43 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I gave up on courier-imap after they changed their entire setup around in some godawful confusing way that I couldn't be bothered to try to sort out.
[2016-05-12 14:49:56 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] bien
[2016-05-12 14:50:02 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If you make it *THAT* fucking hard to use normal unix user accounts with passwords, something is wrong with you.
[2016-05-12 14:50:06 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] es mas o menos lo que necesito
[2016-05-12 14:50:12 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] puedo entrar al modem y activar el wifi
[2016-05-12 14:50:21 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] cloud2butt has been done
[2016-05-12 14:50:29 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] jelly: in my case i don't want my edge MTA storing all of my mail, i want that on my local server, which is then served using IMAP to my desktop/mobile clients
[2016-05-12 14:50:36 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] no tengo nada encontra del modem.... el problema es que no esta del inversor
[2016-05-12 14:50:48 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] y cada que hay cambio de luz los equipos que estan conectado a el pierden la red
[2016-05-12 14:50:58 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] haha
[2016-05-12 14:51:18 -0500] [jelly in #debian] usually people transport mail using some sort of a... simple mail transport protocol
[2016-05-12 14:51:25 -0500] [koollman in #debian] :)
[2016-05-12 14:51:29 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] pero el problema es... que tiene que estar dentro del techo... y no quiisiera romper en vano...
[2016-05-12 14:51:37 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] bahahaha "Build Your OpenStack Butt in Minutes, Butt Resources On Demand"
[2016-05-12 14:51:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I don't know what IMAP IDLE is, but a reverse ssh tunnel would also allow you to deliver mail from the "edge server" to the "local server" even if the "edge server" cannot make a direct SMTP connection to the "local server".
[2016-05-12 14:52:01 -0500] [jelly in #debian] greycat: think "push notifications"
[2016-05-12 14:52:09 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I was guessing something like that.
[2016-05-12 14:52:12 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] si existiera algo... como el radar de las esferas del dragon....
[2016-05-12 14:52:15 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] jelly: i did think about forwarding, but that has the downside that if my home server goes offline for an extended period of time (it has happened unexpectedly due to ISP dumbness) then my edge MTA is going to start bouncing stuff
[2016-05-12 14:52:15 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] ah fijate status: already exists osea que el curl ese tiene limites?
[2016-05-12 14:52:16 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] :P
[2016-05-12 14:52:26 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] xDD
[2016-05-12 14:52:26 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] no que yo sepa
[2016-05-12 14:52:31 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Um.  And this is a problem because...?
[2016-05-12 14:52:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] how is Australia on Eurovision?!
[2016-05-12 14:53:12 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] I don't even.  But her song and her voice are very nice.
[2016-05-12 14:53:18 -0500] [adamsilver in #bash] How do I store the result of this in a variable: $dir | awk -F/ '{print $(NF-2)}'
[2016-05-12 14:53:23 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] you ask too many questions.

[2016-05-12 14:53:30 -0500] [greybot in #bash] http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/002 -- How can I store the return value and/or output of a command in a variable?
[2016-05-12 14:53:33 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] it seems a bit obvious to me?
[2016-05-12 14:53:46 -0500] [greycat in #debian] if your mail server is down for 10 days, then mail bounces.
[2016-05-12 14:53:52 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops: :O Fue originalmente desarrollada por Hobbit en 1996 <- que hobbit sera? Frodo?

[2016-05-12 14:54:13 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] in the case where i control both the edge and the local server, i would rather mail pool on the edge indefinitely until the local server comes back up
[2016-05-12 14:54:15 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] seria sam
[2016-05-12 14:54:21 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You are weird.
[2016-05-12 14:54:21 -0500] [adamsilver in #bash] I actually tried that but it's giving an error
[2016-05-12 14:54:25 -0500] [jelly in #debian] 5 days, but SerajewelKS controls his own previous hop, so he can configure whatever queue lifetime
[2016-05-12 14:54:38 -0500] [adamsilver in #bash] bad substitution
[2016-05-12 14:54:39 -0500] [KatsWhoSayNi in #bash] surely you mean echo "$dir" | awk ...
[2016-05-12 14:54:45 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Well, a fixed number of days, generally around 7, configured in the MTA.
[2016-05-12 14:55:00 -0500] [greycat in #bash] or awk '...' <<< "$dir"
[2016-05-12 14:55:07 -0500] [yitz_ in #bash] awl <<< "$d"  ...

[2016-05-12 14:55:23 -0500] [jelly in #debian] I've... not seen anytihng larger than 5 says since I first saw a Sendmail install 20 years back
[2016-05-12 14:55:30 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] greycat: i am treating the local server as a mail store, not an MTA -- if mail can be delivered to the edge MTA i don't want to lose it.  it's my mail.  if my mail store is down then it can sit there until the mail store becomes available.
[2016-05-12 14:55:36 -0500] [yitz_ in #bash] adamsilver: Yes, FAQ2. If you got an error, do it right. Feel free to share the error here
[2016-05-12 14:55:36 -0500] [greycat in #bash] or  IFS=/ read -ra x <<< "$dir"; variable=${x[@]:(-2):1}

[2016-05-12 14:56:50 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] (and then i have the fallback option of sshing to my edge server and reading the mail with mutt)

[2016-05-12 14:57:26 -0500] [larryba in ##windows] i didn't know task scheduler is this neat
[2016-05-12 14:57:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] why not always use the remote imap server, then
[2016-05-12 14:57:38 -0500] [jelly in #debian] (pop3 must die)
[2016-05-12 14:57:52 -0500] [yitz_ in #bash] Oops. Heh. I was thinking of the $ in $dir but I suppose that works
[2016-05-12 14:58:06 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Set up a script that sshes to the remote box and runs the queue.  Set the "local server" up to run that script every time you open your MUA.
[2016-05-12 14:58:08 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] i'm not fond of all of my mail sitting in storage on rented hardware
[2016-05-12 14:58:10 -0500] [adamsilver in #bash] >"$QUOTE" "$EVERY" "$FUCKING" "$EXPANSION" ... why is that? I don't like adding superfluous stuff. Bash syntax is not the prettiest and adding stuff that could be omitted make it worse

[2016-05-12 15:02:00 -0500] [greybot in #bash] August is the month when all your scripts break because you placed $(date +%m) in a variable and tried to do arithmetic with it, without removing the leading zeros. 08 is considered octal. Use $((10#$month)) to force decimal, or strip the zero.
[2016-05-12 15:02:18 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] commiting xD
[2016-05-12 15:02:25 -0500] [shenk` in #django] Basically, the email is never sent and the logging in form_valid in the CBV is never called so the form never seems to be valid.  Also the model isn't saved.  I'm not sure whether to write a save method inside the form, or to just call form.save() inside the contact CBV.
