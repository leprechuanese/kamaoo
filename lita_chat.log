[2016-05-23 00:04:43 -0500] [babilen in #debian] n_blownapart: Check your current working directory for the file
[2016-05-23 00:04:48 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i loved it as a kid
[2016-05-23 00:05:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] hey polyzen
[2016-05-23 00:05:30 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] o/
[2016-05-23 00:05:36 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thanks man
[2016-05-23 00:06:36 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] it's probably like McDonald's
[2016-05-23 00:06:47 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] deceptively tasty, not at all filling
[2016-05-23 00:07:15 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] those fries kill my stomach every time
[2016-05-23 00:07:19 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] but I love em
[2016-05-23 00:07:25 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] haven't had McD's in ages..
[2016-05-23 00:07:39 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] our mcdonalds has very bad tasting ketchup.  thats totally uncool.  they get people to buy food from out of pity.  little do they know is that place is likely bankrupt and runs forever because of the treasury.  people have needs
[2016-05-23 00:08:14 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i suspect they have it in quantity and can't get rid of it.   definitely immoral.  even the bible says if it doesn't taste good, don't eat it.
[2016-05-23 00:08:32 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] people need their gov't-subsidized fastfood?
[2016-05-23 00:08:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] polyzen, find the right one and mcdonalds isn't bad
[2016-05-23 00:08:56 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] aw man

[2016-05-23 00:09:04 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] when it was good
[2016-05-23 00:09:24 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] chicken strips, wedges, biscuit.. damn I'm hugrny
[2016-05-23 00:09:26 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i just caught something i made a error in judgement.  i just know know pity happens. but for that ketchup?  its another that which should never be
[2016-05-23 00:09:26 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hungry now
[2016-05-23 00:09:38 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hehe
[2016-05-23 00:09:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] :D
[2016-05-23 00:10:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] if i eat more plentiful these days its my mind's "that thing" glad that says eat or you die.
[2016-05-23 00:10:28 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] its got a gland for that
[2016-05-23 00:11:12 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] because of my disability i have issues going to the grocery store.  only in this case would it be exhaustion from walking.  i can handle things like food and karaoke places
[2016-05-23 00:12:16 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] KFC has good mash potatos.  i remember that from childhood.  i'm sure the rest of their food is too i have an aversion against poultry i can't cure
[2016-05-23 00:12:44 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] ugh kfc
[2016-05-23 00:13:26 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] taco bell has a rocking bell grande nacho with taco, that taco's GOOD.  and those nachos awesome too.  with me it keeps me hungry, but i think my God for that gift.
[2016-05-23 00:13:45 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] more of a boston market kind of guy.
[2016-05-23 00:13:52 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats decent
[2016-05-23 00:14:00 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] haven't had that in a whle
[2016-05-23 00:14:02 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] while
[2016-05-23 00:14:06 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] in fact its probably great much of what i don't eat
[2016-05-23 00:14:07 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] their all-in-one bowls are well worth it.
[2016-05-23 00:14:19 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] they used to have awesome soups
[2016-05-23 00:14:24 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] I don't bother with stuff like Taco Bell because I'd need to eat too much of it then my stomach will be fucked
[2016-05-23 00:14:27 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] something like brocolli and cheese soup
[2016-05-23 00:14:43 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] that does sound good actually.
[2016-05-23 00:14:48 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] Chipotle is nom, but damn expensive
[2016-05-23 00:14:54 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] and even then sometimes you want more
[2016-05-23 00:14:56 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] true
[2016-05-23 00:14:57 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats why i'm eating.  i'm burning a bunch of calories and my brain tells me "arthur -- you need them"  its a survival thing
[2016-05-23 00:15:42 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i try to make my late-night munchies healthy(-er)
[2016-05-23 00:15:47 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] God bless you.  i'm sorry chipolte is out of your range.  i rely on my parents all the time and i spill it to them.  a meal costs 7 bucks
[2016-05-23 00:16:00 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats definitely awesome
[2016-05-23 00:16:14 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] beans, rice, and plantains
[2016-05-23 00:16:18 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] or carrots and hummus
[2016-05-23 00:16:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats what i was getting at earlier.  if you eat clean your whole body thanks you for it.
[2016-05-23 00:16:47 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] definitely
[2016-05-23 00:16:47 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] avis-, well, it's not about being out of my range
[2016-05-23 00:16:53 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] is just frugal
[2016-05-23 00:17:00 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] $9 for a meal is too much
[2016-05-23 00:17:07 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] actually, it's more like $10--$11
[2016-05-23 00:17:25 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i aim for ~$5
[2016-05-23 00:17:49 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] unless it's fancy night. ;)
[2016-05-23 00:17:50 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats fine.  i think thats awesome too.  my bottom line is what will pay for the meal that i want and need, parents pick it up.  when i said as rich as i am, that money isn't in my wallet.
[2016-05-23 00:17:53 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hehe
[2016-05-23 00:18:30 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i think i can have that taco bell meal for $6.  thats one dollar off what my mom gives me.
[2016-05-23 00:18:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] but no wants to eat at the same place all the time
[2016-05-23 00:19:15 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] can't see myself willingly going there again :p
[2016-05-23 00:20:03 -0500] [lider in #debian-es] hola...

[2016-05-23 00:20:52 -0500] [orome in #debian-es-offtopic] News from pdreadful: Penny Dreadful 3x04 A Blade of Grass <magnet:?xt=urn:btih:CCC6D30015C7F30D0C86C96EE27EFB0AB4BEEA6E&dn=Penny+Dreadful+S03E04+HDTV+x264+FLEET&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337>
[2016-05-23 00:20:52 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats reminds me of something.  i once checked into a hospital and said "i need a warehouse.  and walk around in darkness with minimal light and full medical staff and smokes etc.  something that traumatic happened to me that i'd know the cure for it, and yet, it doesn't match the trauma that keeps me with my beloved friends on irc that was even worse than that
[2016-05-23 00:21:29 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] the reason i knew it was the cure is because i was healed once that way after the first traumatic incident.  VERY UNCOOL.
[2016-05-23 00:22:40 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] fruits are awesome.  i know how to eat clean or at least for the win however without me being able to make it to the grocery store i've got to do my best.
[2016-05-23 00:23:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i love apples when i cut them up.  i have sensitive teeth.
[2016-05-23 00:23:34 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'm like awesome !!!!!!!!!!  these fruit decent

[2016-05-23 00:27:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] mom makes us pineapple water after everyone we cut open.  it feels very puerto rico, despite its only very slight change in taste
[2016-05-23 00:27:49 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] definitely it rocks the heck out of ya
[2016-05-23 00:28:00 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] lots of pineapple down there?
[2016-05-23 00:28:05 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i love grilled pineapple.
[2016-05-23 00:28:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] yes sir.
[2016-05-23 00:28:32 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats very good.  i like beef shiskabobs
[2016-05-23 00:28:58 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i'm a veggie, but it is good with meats too.
[2016-05-23 00:29:06 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] provides a sweet/salty taste alongside.
[2016-05-23 00:29:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] please forgive me then its its an offense against ya.  i process comparative religion for the win, which makes me think of shinto.
[2016-05-23 00:30:21 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] nah it's not a religion for me. had some chicken soup at my sister's a couple months ago.
[2016-05-23 00:30:32 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] are the shintos veggie too?
[2016-05-23 00:30:37 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] absolutely
[2016-05-23 00:30:57 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] they don't allow themselves to walk on insects.  preservation of life to honor God is who they are
[2016-05-23 00:32:27 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] interesting. most of my understanding of eastern philosophies is through taoism.
[2016-05-23 00:32:59 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats rearrange me until i'm sane.  are you chinese or asian by chance?

[2016-05-23 00:53:36 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: the server is on my server, I can plug usb devices,
[2016-05-23 00:53:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] nat0, i hear it causes the traffic to be backed up on the highway.  i rest my case
[2016-05-23 00:54:16 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] server is on our server room, I can plug usb devices, but none of the usb devices are recognized, even usb mouse and keyboard, I am accessing server remotely, using ssh

[2016-05-23 00:55:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] is anything plugged in right now? if you can't reboot the server, maybe you can try reloading the kernel modules
[2016-05-23 00:56:53 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, which module all kernel modules
[2016-05-23 00:58:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: no not everything. start with "lspci -k | grep -A2 USB"
[2016-05-23 00:59:09 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: http://paste.debian.net/695820/ yes, this is the output,
[2016-05-23 00:59:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i still consider myself your friend nat0 unless you can't handle it.  just because of separation of state and religion it doesn't mean they're not in bed together.  thats logical coherency.  thats why things must change in this country.
[2016-05-23 00:59:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: take a look at "lsmod | grep ehci"
[2016-05-23 01:00:17 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] hey avis-
[2016-05-23 01:00:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] and i take no offense either.

[2016-05-23 01:01:35 -0500] [lider in #debian-es] eso lo he elido pero ahora no lo encuentro que cosas,,,,
[2016-05-23 01:01:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats a cool song jmcnaught.  do you know why they call themselves death ?  i'm put off in case its sinful.
[2016-05-23 01:02:00 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: when i do lsmod all those modules are already lodaded,
[2016-05-23 01:02:22 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'm as bold as death but no disrepect for my father
[2016-05-23 01:02:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] it was a rockin tune though
[2016-05-23 01:04:47 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] avis-: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_%28protopunk_band%29 they actually recorded a couple of gospel albums (with a different band name)
[2016-05-23 01:05:45 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thanks jmcnaught
[2016-05-23 01:06:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: if everything USB related is nonresponsive then you could try removing and loading the modules using modprobe, but i don't know what's connected by USB on your system or what the consequences might be.
[2016-05-23 01:07:38 -0500] [slax0r in #debian] hello, I am having issues when booting back from hibernation, my previos xrandr setup is not retained, and when I re-run it, my whole system freezes, so I have to "push a pillow over its head" and boot it up normally again, here are some logs: xorg: http://laravel.io/bin/6LQyD messages: http://laravel.io/bin/QNK74 syslog: http://laravel.io/bin/zjqbv and the xranrd command: http://laravel.io/bin/1yDjw
[2016-05-23 01:07:42 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: from your error example it looks to me like some USB device is locked in a state that the kernel can't change for some reason
[2016-05-23 01:08:14 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: I connected the usb mouse, keyboard, and backupdrive, backupdrive is working but other usb devices is not working,
[2016-05-23 01:08:29 -0500] [slax0r in #debian] those logs provide me with very little info, or I am just reading them wrong, is there some other log I can inspect? oh right, kernel is 4.5.0 bpo from jessie backports, and the i5 skylake gfx
[2016-05-23 01:08:44 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, I have got some message  usb 2-1.6: reset full-speed USB device number 32 using ehc from my dmesg output
[2016-05-23 01:10:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: keep researching error message i guess, reloading all the USB modules is not an option while the backup drive is being used
[2016-05-23 01:10:44 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: ok thank you for your guidance, I will
[2016-05-23 01:38:06 -0500] [avis- in #debian] what are possible methods for upgrading to a higher kernel in debian without compiling it yourself ?

[2016-05-23 01:40:55 -0500] [reev in #debian] how can i configure i3
[2016-05-23 01:43:02 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: You essentially select it in the list of window managers in gdm3. It should be listed there and there shouldn't be the need to update alternatives at all
[2016-05-23 01:44:43 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: how to select in list of window managers in gdm3
[2016-05-23 01:44:49 -0500] [reev in #debian] any command?
[2016-05-23 01:53:11 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: You type your user name and hit enter. Then there's a little gear shaped icon, click on it and select your session or, depending on your version, you might have a drop down menu

[2016-05-23 02:05:03 -0500] [Guest25335 in #debian] I'm contemplating to install Qubes OS (for their effortless setup)
[2016-05-23 02:10:41 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: thanks for that but I had automatic user login enabled in /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf which i turned off now but i get login by it
[2016-05-23 02:10:51 -0500] [reev in #debian] *still
[2016-05-23 02:13:09 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: I have never used that feature, but I guess that you have to somehow "select" your user's favourite session. It probably uses whatever you used last time.
[2016-05-23 02:14:07 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: okay I see what can i do
[2016-05-23 02:15:23 -0500] [babilen in #debian] But if you turn of automatic login, why is it still turned on?
[2016-05-23 03:14:11 -0500] [alakx in #debian] Hi, how can i check the build version of a  installed package via apt-get ? For example for the package openssl ?
[2016-05-23 03:21:06 -0500] [samneo in #debian] for checking installed package dpkg -l openssl
[2016-05-23 03:21:22 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] Hi, I'm trying to find a package. It has the same name in the jessie-backports and jessie repos but I want to use the backport one.
[2016-05-23 03:21:51 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] By default, the jone from jessie is installed. how can I force the repo to use?
[2016-05-23 03:21:58 -0500] [bhav in #debian] samneo hi
[2016-05-23 03:22:19 -0500] [samneo in #debian] apt-get provide information from repository
[2016-05-23 03:22:21 -0500] [samneo in #debian] like apt-cache showpkg openssl
[2016-05-23 03:23:38 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] How do I figure out how udev has decided to name my tty device? i.e. why is my barcode scanner /dev/ttyACM0, and not some other tty name?
[2016-05-23 03:24:01 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] samneo: ok, I see that: it's the same info I got from the debian website. but how do I set that during the install?
[2016-05-23 03:24:09 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] so that it peaks the right one?
[2016-05-23 03:24:33 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] s/peak/pick
[2016-05-23 03:33:14 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] samneo: found with the aptitude terminal gui. idk with the command line but it's still ok
[2016-05-23 03:34:20 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: apt-get -t jessie-backports install "package"
[2016-05-23 03:35:05 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: that's why the -t option never worked ;) Promise I'll RTFM
[2016-05-23 03:35:17 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: what?
[2016-05-23 03:35:52 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: I was using aptitude install -t 5.200 package
[2016-05-23 03:36:05 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] with 5.200 the version of the package
[2016-05-23 03:36:23 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] you don't use version, you use the archive for -t
[2016-05-23 03:37:21 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] actually maybe you can, but did you try the target release instead?
[2016-05-23 03:37:42 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] i.e., jessie-backports
[2016-05-23 03:38:16 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: I don't know what you mean by target release. but anyway, command is perfect. thx
[2016-05-23 03:47:46 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: good to hear

[2016-05-23 04:20:07 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I have a weight balance connected to a tty (/dev/ttyUSBn); I can’t have it around every time, so I’d like to mimic it
[2016-05-23 04:20:39 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] is there a way to create a /dev/tty-dummy and have it sending stuff for me to test like a weight balance was plugged in?
[2016-05-23 04:23:52 -0500] [ancky in #debian] phz_: looks like you want a loopback serialport
[2016-05-23 04:24:08 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] well
[2016-05-23 04:24:15 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I need to send stuff in a file

[2016-05-23 04:34:50 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] is there a way to prevent the echo command from sending EOF?
[2016-05-23 04:37:39 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] not that I know of, no
[2016-05-23 04:37:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] only EOL, with -n

[2016-05-23 04:38:10 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] that’s boring
[2016-05-23 04:38:29 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I need to find a way to keep the pipe open
[2016-05-23 04:38:48 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I’m reading in the pipe in python
[2016-05-23 04:40:08 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] not sure how you could go about leaving "echo" running and being able to send more text through the same echo, though. echo would exit and break the pipe

[2016-05-23 05:53:13 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] I know you can download them with youtube-dl and play with mpv, maybe use a terminal browser like w3m to search for them
[2016-05-23 05:53:28 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] mpv can even play videos in your terminal
[2016-05-23 05:53:35 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] Really?

[2016-05-23 05:54:03 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] I might code one
[2016-05-23 05:54:23 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] shoulnd't be too difficult, we already have all tools, as I just said

[2016-05-23 06:48:35 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] to read what I’m typing in with a for line in fh
[2016-05-23 06:48:43 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I have to exit the tee program to get input
[2016-05-23 06:48:45 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] wtf?
[2016-05-23 06:48:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] is called "named pipe", and the reads will be buffered by default
[2016-05-23 06:49:07 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] until it reaches EOF?
[2016-05-23 06:49:18 -0500] [jelly in #debian] so if you write more than... 8192 bytes, I think, you'll get a read() out
[2016-05-23 06:49:22 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I tried running it with stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 though
[2016-05-23 06:49:37 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] jelly: how can I change that behavior?
[2016-05-23 06:50:33 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dunno how that's done in python.  Actually I don't even remember if the buffering is write() side or read() side or both
[2016-05-23 06:51:09 -0500] [jelly in #debian] https://www.google.com/search?q=read+python+named+pipe+unbuffered  ? :-]

[2016-05-23 06:51:30 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] not that much information there
[2016-05-23 06:52:01 -0500] [ChrisWi in #debian] Megaf: Yes ... xen. I have 4 hosts ... but I see this only on two. the two with this log flodding have 2 targets (LUN) ... Any idea ?
[2016-05-23 06:52:09 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] jelly:
[2016-05-23 06:52:16 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] thanks for your help
[2016-05-23 06:53:04 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] nope, still buffering
[2016-05-23 06:53:06 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] ffs
[2016-05-23 06:54:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] phz_: at least one of the results suggests opening in binary mode, 'rb'
[2016-05-23 06:55:38 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] markybob: I don't see any candidate version https://gist.github.com/c4m4/9acb746fbcb8bc3c19cb18bfc927c8ee
[2016-05-23 06:56:58 -0500] [markybob in #debian] f0f4r: you have the latest. you're good. safe. i don't know what you're complaining about.
[2016-05-23 06:58:10 -0500] [sypher in #debian] f0f4r: You already have the latest 2.2 release with backported security fixes. Is there a particular vulnerability that you find hasn't been addressed?
[2016-05-23 06:58:41 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] heh, we keep getting mails from worried customers as well, "you're running a very old apache and php! why haven't you upgraded! it's not safe!"... all patches applied, of course.
[2016-05-23 06:59:01 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] people just see older versions and immediately assume things are insecure tbh
[2016-05-23 06:59:16 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] I would like to know if there is any cve that my webserver has
[2016-05-23 06:59:33 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] ChrisWi, maybe on #Xen ?
[2016-05-23 07:00:12 -0500] [markybob in #debian] f0f4r: you really just can't accept that security gets backported, eh? we're not going to do your meaningless work for you. google it.
[2016-05-23 07:00:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: use security-tracker.debian.org to look up any CVE and see if it's patched
[2016-05-23 07:00:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] also,
[2016-05-23 07:01:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian] !debsecan
[2016-05-23 07:01:02 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] methinks debsecan is a program that reports security advisories against programs installed on the host, similar to gentoo's glsa-check.  See http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/debsecan/.
[2016-05-23 07:01:50 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] jelly: ok, I will try to that site
[2016-05-23 07:02:50 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: if a patch for a known security issue is applied to the version in your debian release, you will usually see it mentioned in the changelog for the package.  zless /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/changelog.Debian.gz
[2016-05-23 07:05:05 -0500] [jelly in #debian] markybob: sometimes an admin has bosses, auditors or customers that want more concrete proof than "<markybob> f0f4r: you have the latest. you're good. safe. i don't know what you're complaining about."
[2016-05-23 07:06:10 -0500] [jelly in #debian] distro's security tracker is a useful reference for such a purpose
[2016-05-23 07:06:14 -0500] [irwiss in #debian] does dpkg care if something is a real folder or symlink? i'd like to move /etc/nginx/ to /www/nginx.conf/ and symlink it, it appears to work from nginx perspective, will i get in trouble with dpkg or other pitfalls?
[2016-05-23 07:06:47 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] Using debsecan I don't see any cve for apache
[2016-05-23 07:06:53 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] Using debsecan I don't see any cve for apache
[2016-05-23 07:07:34 -0500] [jelly in #debian] irwiss: afair, you can only get in trouble after you purge all the packages that bring /etc/nginx directory, I _think_ that gets the symlink removed
[2016-05-23 07:07:40 -0500] [domth7 in #debian] Hi, my browser (Arora, surf, uzbl) crash, and i've found this messege in the term:"Illegal Instruction". My pc is too old, any ideas?
[2016-05-23 07:07:44 -0500] [ChrisWi in #debian] Megaf: ok will try ... you have no idea about those messages to get rid off ?
[2016-05-23 07:08:00 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] nope
[2016-05-23 07:08:36 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: that means it's all patched up, as far as debian knows
[2016-05-23 07:10:11 -0500] [jelly in #debian] assuming you're using debsecan right.  Mine just found something very very old on this machine...
[2016-05-23 07:10:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] ii  apache-common               1.3.34-4.1+etch1   i386               support files for all Apache webservers
[2016-05-23 07:12:28 -0500] [irwiss in #debian] jelly: that makes sense i guess, not planning on purging but backup is on the roadmap once it's settled, thanks
[2016-05-23 07:26:07 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources
[2016-05-23 07:26:20 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] you may try to continue without a kernel, and manually install your own kernel later. this is only recommended for experts
[2016-05-23 07:26:33 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
[2016-05-23 07:26:58 -0500] [digidog in #debian] Hi hello everyone, I am sort of confused: Laptop ACER V3 772G  suddenly reboots without warning randomly with Debian 8 installed, no matter which application runs or if CPU etc is high or not.
[2016-05-23 07:28:34 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] digidog: mcelog installed? That might help detecting a HW issue. Sounds more like a HW problem to me.
[2016-05-23 07:33:47 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, and it worked well before?
[2016-05-23 07:35:34 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] or did you just install debian?
[2016-05-23 07:36:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] ChrisH: cruncher: hard to say, its a laptop I have prepared for somebody who didnt used it a lot. now it stands here and I test it and it seems sth wrong. cpu goes up 72% when I try to remove hplip. maybe thats the devil
[2016-05-23 07:37:30 -0500] [digidog in #debian] shutdown mostly is regarding overhead (security stop)
[2016-05-23 07:37:48 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] so you just installed it, it works, but has high cpu usage, and suddenly reboots (not poweroff)
[2016-05-23 07:39:45 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, overhead? you mean overheat? so it turns off, not reboots
[2016-05-23 07:40:06 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: Isry, yes I was referring to heat.
[2016-05-23 07:40:21 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] then i guess its a hw problem
[2016-05-23 07:40:22 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: it sometomes shuts down, sometimes reboots
[2016-05-23 07:40:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: I have remove hplip now and now cpu usage goes down to 55
[2016-05-23 07:40:56 -0500] [digidog in #debian] remove(d)
[2016-05-23 07:41:05 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] so what is using the cpu?
[2016-05-23 07:41:34 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but basically its clear, somethig is using the cpu, it gets hot, and as it cant cool it enough it turns off
[2016-05-23 07:41:41 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] basically you have 2 problems
[2016-05-23 07:41:46 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: hplip 12 %. maybe its more obvious today since here are 30 degress so the room is much warmer
[2016-05-23 07:42:20 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] yes, that too :) if you would sit in alaska it wouldnt happen probably :P
[2016-05-23 07:42:34 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: now it runs normal after removing hplip -> http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html
[2016-05-23 07:42:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: :-D
[2016-05-23 07:43:05 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] well, if you identified hplip as the culprit...
[2016-05-23 07:43:29 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] im particularly interested because i was thinking to get the E5-773 laptop, and was curious how it works with debian
[2016-05-23 07:43:38 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: I agree with you, I think also there are more then one issue. maybe hplip messed up somehow and eats a lot, but thats with 12% not issue enogh for the overheat actually
[2016-05-23 07:44:57 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] hey, /proc/cpuinfo says both cores of my cpu are running at around 230MHz (this is a 3.3GHz machine at full load) - what could this mean?
[2016-05-23 07:45:41 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: any good hw test utisl for debian to check if all cores runs ok etc ?
[2016-05-23 07:45:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it means it's on
[2016-05-23 07:46:02 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] markybob: but why is the frequency so low?
[2016-05-23 07:46:03 -0500] [dTal in #debian] I was gonna say that they've been clocked down for powersave, but that seems unusually low
[2016-05-23 07:46:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i have chrome alone using 26% right now
[2016-05-23 07:46:23 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] markybob: the cores themselves are running at 230 MHz
[2016-05-23 07:47:27 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] dTal: I was thinking it's hardware failure, as I do recall a weird message about overheating appearing once in dmesg - but not since, and I've even cleaned the fans, and changed nothing in BIOS...
[2016-05-23 07:47:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i've never seen that. the computer would always shut itself off if it got so hot it had to run that slowly
[2016-05-23 07:48:26 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, did you try what ChrisH suggested?
[2016-05-23 07:49:04 -0500] [dTal in #debian] Trieste: if you switch your CPU governor to "Performace" does it go to full speed?
[2016-05-23 07:49:15 -0500] [dTal in #debian] maybe your CPU just supports unusually low clock speeds
[2016-05-23 07:49:19 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] dTal: how would I do that?
[2016-05-23 07:50:12 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] (by the way, the load is roughly about at 2.5)
[2016-05-23 07:51:05 -0500] [dTal in #debian] depends on your chipset, usually you can cat something somewhere in /sys
[2016-05-23 07:51:35 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: sry, that was run out of the view here
[2016-05-23 07:52:05 -0500] [digidog in #debian] ChrisH: sry, I didn't kep in mind your answer. I will check
[2016-05-23 07:52:18 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] ooh, so there is something interesting in dmesg after all
[2016-05-23 07:52:43 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] "Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled" and "Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled"
[2016-05-23 07:52:58 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] but what the heck
[2016-05-23 07:53:42 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, you could try the intel processor diagnostic tool from Intel
[2016-05-23 07:53:43 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] http://www.tcsscreening.com/files/users/IPDT_LiveUSB/index.html
[2016-05-23 07:53:49 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but i dont know if it works with debian
[2016-05-23 07:54:08 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but honestly i doubt the cpu is "broken"

[2016-05-23 08:26:51 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I guess blkid might be from busybox?

[2016-05-23 08:28:11 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] how to install linux kernel?
[2016-05-23 08:28:16 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] apt-get ?
[2016-05-23 08:28:23 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] apt-get install linux-image
[2016-05-23 08:28:30 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] I think
[2016-05-23 08:28:34 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] (or just "apt" on jessie)
[2016-05-23 08:28:47 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] but if you're already running Debian, you already have a kernel installed :)
[2016-05-23 08:28:50 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ...I couldn't get used to "just apt" :)
[2016-05-23 08:28:57 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] fireba11, what?? OMG
[2016-05-23 08:29:07 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: ah well ... it got a progess bar(tm) :-D
[2016-05-23 08:29:14 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] :D
[2016-05-23 08:29:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: try "file -s" with proceeding full path to the disk/part
[2016-05-23 08:29:34 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] naptastic: No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources. you may try to continue without a kernel, and manually install your own kernel later. this is only recommended for experts
[2016-05-23 08:29:35 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] it's more that apt-get is kinda hardwired when I'm typing
[2016-05-23 08:29:36 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I dont have "file" :(
[2016-05-23 08:30:10 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] Package linux-image is not avaiiable, but is referred to by another package
[2016-05-23 08:30:10 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] so much that if I need to use apt-cache, I already typed apt-get and then have to backspace 4 times and type cache ;)
[2016-05-23 08:30:13 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] FinalX, yep... and RHEL / CentOS are going from yum -> dnf in a couple of years...
[2016-05-23 08:30:15 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] e: package linux-image has no intallation candidate
[2016-05-23 08:30:32 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: thanks for all the cues. well yeah I doubt its the cpu two. but I will try more hw test utils and check if anything intersting pops up and let you know (because of ACER)
[2016-05-23 08:30:32 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: also it seems you still need things like apt-cache
[2016-05-23 08:30:49 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: how did you manage that?
[2016-05-23 08:30:54 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, what version of Debian is this? `cat /etc/debian_version`
[2016-05-23 08:31:01 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
[2016-05-23 08:31:03 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] also, yeah, what did you do? :|
[2016-05-23 08:31:07 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ok
[2016-05-23 08:31:09 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i installed it
[2016-05-23 08:31:15 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] and it said this
[2016-05-23 08:31:15 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] oops, which reminds me, I have to send an e-mail back to the guy who helped me when I e-mailed the APT-maintainers.. I'm awful, didn't even thank him o.O
[2016-05-23 08:31:17 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: oh well. does "dmesg" show you any hints?
[2016-05-23 08:31:29 -0500] [gypsymauro in #debian] it seems that newver versions of debian has changed rourint priority ? on older debian I've 192.168.1.0 routing then 0.0.0.0 on newer I've before 0.0.0.0 then 192.168.1.0, how can I change this behavioour?
[2016-05-23 08:32:00 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: nope :(
[2016-05-23 08:32:13 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, what's the output of `uname -a` ?
[2016-05-23 08:32:14 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: strace the mount? idk
[2016-05-23 08:32:36 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] no strace either :P
[2016-05-23 08:32:42 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] naptastic linux debian 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt25-1 (2016-03-06) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[2016-05-23 08:32:43 -0500] [defanor in #debian] j`ey: stat? ls?
[2016-05-23 08:33:09 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] ls works, and shows both the /dev/sda1 and /mnt/x exist
[2016-05-23 08:33:27 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, ok, try `apt install linux-image-3.16.0-4-amd64`
[2016-05-23 08:33:40 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] naptastic: not that good an idea
[2016-05-23 08:33:45 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] thanks that worked
[2016-05-23 08:33:50 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] O_O
[2016-05-23 08:33:51 -0500] [dvs in #debian] too late
[2016-05-23 08:34:03 -0500] [telecity in #debian] mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/x -> "no such file or directory"?
[2016-05-23 08:34:07 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey:
[2016-05-23 08:34:14 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] telecity: does x exists?
[2016-05-23 08:34:22 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: yes
[2016-05-23 08:34:46 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: naptastic: you want some soet of meta package usually like linux-image-amd64
[2016-05-23 08:34:50 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] "mounting /dev/sda1 on /mnt/x failed: no such file or directory"
[2016-05-23 08:35:11 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: can you cd to /mnt/x?
[2016-05-23 08:35:25 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] is there still a nspluginwrapper package somewhere? Or is there any other way to run 32bit java app in 64bit OS?
[2016-05-23 08:35:37 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: yup
[2016-05-23 08:35:49 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] fireba11: that progress bar is creeping me out
[2016-05-23 08:36:00 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] just gave it a go :)
[2016-05-23 08:36:02 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: :-D
[2016-05-23 08:36:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: cat < /dev/sda1 > /tmp/a0 = and this works?
[2016-05-23 08:37:13 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] that did work (except it failed with run out of space on device error)
[2016-05-23 08:37:25 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: there are some other new things like apt update reports back if there are things you could upgrade
[2016-05-23 08:37:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: yea should've used /dev/null.. my bad
[2016-05-23 08:37:56 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] fireba11: yeah, I noticed, pretty sweet. then again, it's only for my own server.. most servers are managed through puppet with unattended upgrades and all, too :)
[2016-05-23 08:38:12 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: i think you should message "jelly", i'm useless further
[2016-05-23 08:38:14 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: going to reboot, think that messed stuff up
[2016-05-23 08:39:28 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: depends. i got 7 debian servers but all with very different tasks. i upgrade manually because some upgrades might require a restart of a 3rd party application of a maintenance window. puppet is for several servers with similar or identical tasks
[2016-05-23 08:40:52 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] sure, we have that too, but most things can be upgraded without any issue
[2016-05-23 08:41:06 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] database software i won't, obviously
[2016-05-23 08:41:22 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] openssh/openssl etc however can and should be upgraded asap
[2016-05-23 08:42:01 -0500] [defanor in #debian] j`ey: is that device listed in fstab?
[2016-05-23 08:42:21 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I would guess not, since it's in the installer
[2016-05-23 08:42:25 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] fireba11: can't i install that after reboot?
[2016-05-23 08:42:28 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] or best to just reinstall now
[2016-05-23 08:42:36 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] saludos
[2016-05-23 08:42:52 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] acabo de instalar xrdp en un escritorio KDE4-FULL
[2016-05-23 08:43:01 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] pero no me funciona
[2016-05-23 08:43:08 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] y no encuentro informacion en la web
[2016-05-23 08:43:12 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] de como ponerlo a trabajar
[2016-05-23 08:44:46 -0500] [dvs in #debian] AlexPortable, reinstall?  You can install linux-image-amd64 and it won't interfere with anything
[2016-05-23 08:44:53 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] well i have now the special package
[2016-05-23 08:44:54 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: it's not THAT important ... it just will prevent your kernel from getting dist-upgraded with the newxt new release automatically if you amnually install a specific kernel
[2016-05-23 08:44:55 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] should i remove it again?
[2016-05-23 08:45:10 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] oh
[2016-05-23 08:46:47 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] usa reminna
[2016-05-23 08:46:50 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] o como se llame asimoviano
[2016-05-23 08:47:19 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] x4w3: xrdp no es un cliente
[2016-05-23 08:47:22 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] es un servidor
[2016-05-23 08:47:53 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] :) si verdad
[2016-05-23 08:47:55 -0500] [darxmurf in #debian] okay, mysqldump + vim = yay

[2016-05-23 08:48:16 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] telecity: vim can do regex replaces.
[2016-05-23 08:48:21 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] es que instalar xrdp en linux es raro :P
[2016-05-23 08:48:23 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] vim can do sed stuff fine, too :)
[2016-05-23 08:48:26 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] porque tengo acceso a xrdp

[2016-05-23 08:48:32 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] arguably easier than with sed tbh

[2016-05-23 09:29:23 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] i have two debian machines that when i update kernel to +4.x
[2016-05-23 09:29:33 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] it hangs on boot in services like bind
[2016-05-23 09:29:40 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] very wierd, anyone has a clue on that?
[2016-05-23 09:30:05 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] i have udev/kmod/init scripts, and almost all packages on the system updated
[2016-05-23 09:30:16 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] very odd, never happened such thing to me
[2016-05-23 09:41:33 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Which release are you running on both of them?
[2016-05-23 09:41:57 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] petn-randall: sid
[2016-05-23 09:42:13 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: What CPUs do they have?
[2016-05-23 09:42:20 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] it's something only with this two machines, all others work OK

[2016-05-23 09:43:34 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: You can add remove 'quiet splash' from the kernel parameter line in grub, maybe that will show you some more information.
[2016-05-23 09:44:23 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] petn-randall: im using lilo, no splash, i see all messages
[2016-05-23 09:44:31 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Also check /var/log/daemon.log for any errors. And 'systemd-analyze critical-chain' to check where exactly it hangs.
[2016-05-23 09:44:37 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] no splash or framebuffer or so
[2016-05-23 09:45:00 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Since most things are started in parallel, it may seem that it hangs because of A, but in reality it's because of B.
[2016-05-23 09:45:32 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] can be a fact
[2016-05-23 09:49:23 -0500] [defanor in #debian] i consider using debian packages to deploy/update programs at work, but those programs usually require packages that are either not present or too old in debian repositories, so they use language-dependent package managers. some of those are compiled and linked statically with the libraries, and others are interpreted. should i just hack things in the `rules` file, is there a better way, or is it a bad idea to use deb packages for that?
[2016-05-23 09:50:40 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] I am having issues in a wheezy install where titlebar and title fonts are showing as rectangle boxes. Obviously it seems like a fonts issue or a locale issue, but nothing I've done seems to fix it. Anyone have experience with this issue?
[2016-05-23 09:52:08 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] defanor: I try to use Debian packages where I can, simply because I don't have to track security updates in those packages. If you can't use them, because they're too old or built with different flags than you need, you have to weave them into the deployment part of your system. There's really no general best practice for that, as every language cooks their own stuff.
[2016-05-23 09:52:17 -0500] [defanor in #debian] LowValueTarget: try to set another font in your window manager, and/or check its logs, maybe
[2016-05-23 09:52:29 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] defanor: i've done that
[2016-05-23 09:52:32 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] nothing of note in the logs
[2016-05-23 09:52:59 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] Also, if it helps, this just started happening on a 6-month old install

[2016-05-23 10:09:07 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] but then you still have a 64 bit browser
[2016-05-23 10:09:20 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: Probably not, depends on the details.
[2016-05-23 10:09:31 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: Is there a reason you want to install a 32 bit java?
[2016-05-23 10:09:32 -0500] [parcs in #debian] uh oh, apt wants to remove libc6
[2016-05-23 10:09:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] petn-randall: yes, I need to run webex
[2016-05-23 10:09:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] who would have a need for that!
[2016-05-23 10:09:48 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] !tell parcs about bat
[2016-05-23 10:09:50 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] and webex doesn't support 64 bit java
[2016-05-23 10:10:22 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] can't you just install a 32bit browser as well?
[2016-05-23 10:10:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] then how do I choose to launch the 32 bit browser for webex and not for the rest?
[2016-05-23 10:11:11 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] not sure you can install both at the same time, but if you can just use the full path..
[2016-05-23 10:11:23 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] won't they have both the same name?
[2016-05-23 10:11:29 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] probably
[2016-05-23 10:11:34 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] if I do apt-get install iceweasel:i386
[2016-05-23 10:11:49 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] it will conflict with iceweasel:amd64
[2016-05-23 10:12:15 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] yeah, so pick one. or use a vm, or a different browser, or avoid such software..
[2016-05-23 10:12:35 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I cannot avoid that software, and I am running in a VM atm, but I expected a cleaner solution
[2016-05-23 10:12:45 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] or bootstrap i386 debian into a dir and run it chrooted :P
[2016-05-23 10:13:26 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] at some point, there was nspluginwrapper which allowed to run 32bit java in 64 bit proxy, but the package deosn't exist anymore
[2016-05-23 10:13:37 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] fwiw, my first search result for that has a guide for ubuntu that only installs a few 32bit libs
[2016-05-23 10:14:14 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] s/proxy/browser/
[2016-05-23 10:15:23 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I tried to install the 32bit libs in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ and then start it, but that fails
[2016-05-23 10:15:57 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] (and yes, I did ldconfig)
[2016-05-23 10:16:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] what about libc6-i386 ?
[2016-05-23 10:16:55 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] or was that the one you tried?
[2016-05-23 10:17:19 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I did that, and also installed all the java libss listed in the ldd of webex
[2016-05-23 10:17:23 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ah
[2016-05-23 10:17:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] and compiling the old nspluginwrapper fails on me too
[2016-05-23 10:17:42 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: It's probably easier and less error prone to just maintain a 32-bit chroot with the necessary packages.
[2016-05-23 10:17:43 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] //usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgthread-2.0.so.0: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
[2016-05-23 10:18:01 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] yes, I think it's the only way to go
[2016-05-23 10:18:19 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: You just need the 32 bit browser installed, it can run under your (non-chrooted) X11.
[2016-05-23 10:18:51 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] wasn't there a package to populate a chroot?

[2016-05-23 10:29:16 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Hi, a short question as I'm not entirely sure how it's handled. If you login via SSH using only a key file does that mean the user you're logging in with doesn't have a password?
[2016-05-23 10:29:34 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] no, they are seperate
[2016-05-23 10:29:51 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] a user can have a password, and have an authorized ssh key, or both, or neither
[2016-05-23 10:30:28 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] password authentication can be disabled in the ssh daemon, so only authorized ssh key auth is allowed, or vice versa, or to allow both

[2016-05-23 10:33:56 -0500] [telecity in #debian] if you're going for the password
[2016-05-23 10:35:17 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Ok. So that part should be ok. The real issue I'm working on is understanding the mail-server configuration. As much as it shames me it seems like someone is trying to send spam using my mail server and i can't really tell why (yet).
[2016-05-23 10:36:14 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: misconfiguration sounds like a likely scenario
[2016-05-23 10:36:33 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: which MTA?
[2016-05-23 10:37:48 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Probably, yes. it's postfix and I am seeing some Probably. "Relay access denied;" messages. I've pretty much tracked it down to a line which looks like a valid login. The quesiton is if for some reason the password isn't checked for the SMTP access or if the password for that account was leaked somehow. Both cases are pretty ... bad.
[2016-05-23 10:38:24 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] telecity: Either your MTA is set up as an open relay (naughty!), or some user space program is sending them (you may have some broken web application running on it?), or you've got a trojan.

[2016-05-23 10:39:48 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Meh... all pretty bad. I guess it's PW changeing time ... for all accounts on that server. Thanks for hints and helping clearing it up so quickly. :)
[2016-05-23 10:39:48 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Check /var/log/mail.log where the actual spam comes from. You can also paste those lines + some context to http://paste.debian.net for us to see.
[2016-05-23 10:40:12 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Do you know it's from any user on that system?
[2016-05-23 10:40:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: you asked a question about passwords at first.. using PAM for your MTA?
[2016-05-23 10:40:45 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] PrimalHunter: you can have postfix use a different mechanism
[2016-05-23 10:43:38 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Those are the parts in mail.log that I found that show when the spam starts http://paste.debian.net/hidden/98011cf2/

[2016-05-23 10:49:08 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] And this would be my current postfix config. http://paste.debian.net/hidden/bd8faa95/
[2016-05-23 10:49:36 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Looks like your SASL setup is somehow broken. Is seth@sturdy-byte.net a valid user on that system?
[2016-05-23 10:49:47 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] yes, it would be
[2016-05-23 10:50:15 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Looks like that user's password was somehow retrieved. Should this user be allowed to send mail?
[2016-05-23 10:50:17 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] yesterday's word-cloud: https://ptpb.pw/4Mv5.png
[2016-05-23 10:51:44 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] yes, I guess one of the other services had to be compromised than. At least I never changed the password after generting the user. That is concerning. *sigh* A lot of work is waiting. \o/
