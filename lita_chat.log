[2016-05-12 15:21:58 -0500] [pitolek in #django] maybe use http://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/1.9/django.views.generic.edit/FormView/ as guide to what's happening
[2016-05-12 15:22:07 -0500] [osse in #bash] No one has objected to it yet. So that's good
[2016-05-12 15:22:14 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] I cant see my D-drive. No matter what drive it (usb, internal SATA or whatever) it wont show up in explorer when its D. I can assign another letter (like Z) and it works just fine. I can see the partition/drive in disk management, but explorer is weird.. ? :/
[2016-05-12 15:22:27 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] but gott, rly?
[2016-05-12 15:22:39 -0500] [ZeloZelos in ##windows] vooze, did you try a restart?
[2016-05-12 15:22:51 -0500] [geirha in #bash] Objection, your Honor! Leading the witness!
[2016-05-12 15:22:54 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] ZeloZelos, oh yeah, its an "old" issue, I just cant figure out.
[2016-05-12 15:23:01 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] And I really dont want to format because of it.
[2016-05-12 15:23:07 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] it's a zwiebelfisch
[2016-05-12 15:23:13 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] have you tried assigning the letter manually?
[2016-05-12 15:23:22 -0500] [ZeloZelos in ##windows] have you ever assigned a letter to that device?
[2016-05-12 15:23:27 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] could you have assigned that letter to a persistant network drive?
[2016-05-12 15:23:28 -0500] [Slartibartfast in ##windows] vooze: if you assign it z:, and open diskpart, can you see another volume assigned D:?

[2016-05-12 15:24:18 -0500] [BlenderPro in #debian] is there a package for debian 8.1 that allows me to capture video from a dv bridge
[2016-05-12 15:24:27 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] which package provides or reads from the /etc/network/interfaces file?
[2016-05-12 15:24:33 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] zwiebelsuppe should be added. basics.
[2016-05-12 15:24:34 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] blkshp, yes that works. Its only the letter D thats the problem.
[2016-05-12 15:24:54 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Why would you be three point-released behind on stable?
[2016-05-12 15:24:54 -0500] [shenk` in #django] what should the form action be?
[2016-05-12 15:25:03 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] i asked if you had assigned it D: manually and you said it works but is a problem. clarify please!
[2016-05-12 15:25:09 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] Slartibartfast, let me check, but, right now, I can see my external harddrive in disk management as D.

[2016-05-12 15:25:15 -0500] [greycat in #debian] devster31: the ifup and ifdown commands, for starters.
[2016-05-12 15:25:16 -0500] [lpapp in #pocoo] he stayed less than two minutes... he had no way of judging the traffic.
[2016-05-12 15:25:34 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] so you can see a D drive now?
[2016-05-12 15:25:40 -0500] [greycat in #debian] devster31: then, whatever boot scripts (systemd something something?) that use those commands.
[2016-05-12 15:25:40 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] blkshp, no, Windows choose that. If i assign it Z, plug in ANOTHER drive, it will become D, and I can't see it.
[2016-05-12 15:25:43 -0500] [lpapp in #pocoo] he waited less than two minutes... he had no way of judging the traffic.*
[2016-05-12 15:25:50 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] cant see it, cant see it how?
[2016-05-12 15:26:12 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] sorry im nlost
[2016-05-12 15:26:15 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] it's now showing up in explorer under "This PC"
[2016-05-12 15:26:22 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] good
[2016-05-12 15:26:25 -0500] [yohan4ws in ##windows] you can get to d: from command prompt and dir ???
[2016-05-12 15:26:32 -0500] [pitolek in #django] the url where you want to handle the incoming post ..
[2016-05-12 15:26:33 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] but I can clearly see it in disk management
[2016-05-12 15:26:42 -0500] [blkshp in ##windows] does Now mean Not?
[2016-05-12 15:26:45 -0500] [pitolek in #django] just leave it empty for the same url
[2016-05-12 15:27:08 -0500] [shenk` in #django] ahh that's probably one of the problems, ihave it set to send-feedback which is nothing
[2016-05-12 15:27:09 -0500] [vooze in ##windows] yohan4ws, I can go to D:\ in explorer and it works, it just does not show up, in the sidebar.
[2016-05-12 15:27:10 -0500] [ZeloZelos in ##windows] that letter may already be a drive is either a system partition or a boot partition.
[2016-05-12 15:27:26 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] service should be ifup@.service I assumed they were dependent on ifconfig

[2016-05-12 15:27:41 -0500] [pitolek in #django] either leave it empty, or use revere() on it
