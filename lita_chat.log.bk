[2016-05-15 20:27:54 -0500] [incal in #debian] how do I autostart a process on boot in a specific tty with systemd? I managed to start the process but the I/O isn't in the tty
[2016-05-15 20:46:36 -0500] [Arthur_D in #debian] how can I find the broadcast address of my interface?
[2016-05-15 20:47:03 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] I use command "sudo pand -n -c A4:CE:06:03:E0:16 -p10 -i hci0 -u /etc/bluetooth/pan/dev-up" it brings up "bnep0" interface but looks like commands from "dev-up" file don't run at all, they should bring interface up, assign ip, and assign route, but its if I don't use "-u file" option at all, so I need to run that file separately, so why do you
[2016-05-15 20:47:08 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian]  think it doesn't run by "pand" itself as it should ?
[2016-05-15 20:47:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Arthur_D: /sbin/ifconfig -a will tell you what it's set at
