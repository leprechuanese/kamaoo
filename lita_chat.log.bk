[2016-05-25 00:13:33 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] how much you want
[2016-05-25 00:14:22 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] use the sudo apt-get install --dont-remove-anything-at-all-possibly-resulting-in-broken-pkg-db-which-I-dont-care-about option maybe ?
[2016-05-25 00:15:46 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] or perhaps... sudo apt-get install --alternative-sysroot=/opt ? (perhaps installing a crap ton of stuff into an alternative sysroot without causing any harm to the base system ?)
[2016-05-25 00:16:03 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] gtristan: you're better off asking in the support channel or forum of that distro
[2016-05-25 00:16:14 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] !based on debian
[2016-05-25 00:16:14 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
[2016-05-25 00:17:42 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] jmcnaught, its not a distro really, apt is only available for dev purposes after unlocking that and disabling the ostree repo stuff, except that the deb source is unavailable
[2016-05-25 00:18:08 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] I just need to use the debian *tooling* to pull out build essential or even just a compiler
[2016-05-25 00:19:27 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] gtristan: i don't get what you mean. is it a derivative of debian, or is a frankdebian hybrid?
[2016-05-25 00:20:06 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] if it's originally wheezy or jessie, don't install stuff from testing, you cannot mix releases like that.
[2016-05-25 00:20:50 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] Its a device which uses some readonly-ostree to perform atomic updates, the content of which is contructed with a debian downstream
[2016-05-25 00:21:21 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] they provide a script to undo that, purely for possibly destructive hacking purposes
[2016-05-25 00:21:49 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] but the repo is not online... my only task: Compile a specific software on that device and see if it works
[2016-05-25 00:22:26 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] for that I will need to build and install libgsystem, ostree and another package from source
[2016-05-25 00:23:29 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] Sure, I could wait until those people on the west coast of america start waking up after midnight here and see about it, but it would be great to not lose a day and just force install some build tools
[2016-05-25 00:25:28 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] gtristan: sounds like you should wait for the support of the people who provide this system if you cannot install packages because of some non-Debian repo setup
[2016-05-25 00:31:06 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] :-S
[2016-05-25 00:33:59 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i like tace bell

[2016-05-25 00:35:53 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught are you bi?
[2016-05-25 00:36:14 -0500] [gtristan in #debian] thinks he can get away with using a live bootable USB of any armhf debian system until then
[2016-05-25 00:36:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] avis-: bi?
[2016-05-25 00:37:03 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] definitely what i meant
[2016-05-25 00:37:24 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] you said superman was cute
[2016-05-25 00:37:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] avis-: i think it's inappropriate to ask people about their sexuality here
[2016-05-25 00:37:46 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] or comment on it
[2016-05-25 00:37:52 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i did until i analyzed family friendly
[2016-05-25 00:38:01 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] have ya ?
[2016-05-25 00:39:47 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] it has nothing to do with family friendliness, it's just rude and personal to ask someone
[2016-05-25 00:40:13 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] do you have a mommy or daddy ?  if so could they have raised you different ?
[2016-05-25 00:40:57 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'm sorry it hurt our friendship despite it not being against channel rules
[2016-05-25 00:41:58 -0500] [vvande in #debian] somebody got a link to a Debian ISO that does not have a preselected DE?
[2016-05-25 00:43:51 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: the download link at https://www.debian.org/ is a net installer. debian-installer is the same on all ISOs, the difference is which packages are on that image versus needing to be downloaded
[2016-05-25 00:44:06 -0500] [vvande in #debian] thanks
[2016-05-25 00:44:18 -0500] [vvande in #debian] that is what I've been looking at, and can't find what I want
[2016-05-25 00:44:39 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I'm looking for just the OS so I can install the DE of my choice after
[2016-05-25 00:44:50 -0500] [vvande in #debian] like fluxbox or KDE
[2016-05-25 00:46:50 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] it's a question of what is appropriate, not one of rules. this is a public place.
[2016-05-25 00:48:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: the installer has a "select software" stage where "desktop environment" is often checked by default. you can unselect this task, and install whatever you want with the package manager after the first boot
[2016-05-25 00:48:55 -0500] [vvande in #debian] thanks :)
[2016-05-25 00:49:12 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i support you
[2016-05-25 00:49:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] further by supporting you i suggest ignore
[2016-05-25 00:50:08 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: you can also choose KDE on that screen, the installer has six (i think) different DE to choose from in the installer
[2016-05-25 00:50:11 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I know how to configure an already installed system / delete stuff and add another desktop environment. I have a number of desktop machines. however, I was hoping that Debian would offer something basic for a CD image. I'll keep Googling - I'm sure it's there somewhere.
[2016-05-25 00:50:43 -0500] [vvande in #debian] is there not a basic system for downloadine - I'm looking for Debian 7
[2016-05-25 00:50:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: what do you mean "basic"?
[2016-05-25 00:52:16 -0500] [vvande in #debian] how about a server version?
[2016-05-25 00:52:43 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I've ended up with Gnome on my previous installs and it's a bit of a drag.
[2016-05-25 00:52:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: the net installer linked to on the front page is what you want. just deselect desktop environment
[2016-05-25 00:53:05 -0500] [vvande in #debian] Can I put that on a CD?
[2016-05-25 00:53:33 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: are you trying to build a live CD or soemthing?
[2016-05-25 00:53:45 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] or do you just want to install Debian?
[2016-05-25 00:53:52 -0500] [vvande in #debian] OK, I'll come clean. :)
[2016-05-25 00:54:05 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I just installed VirtualBox for the first time and wanted a CD to try.
[2016-05-25 00:54:35 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I've got a lot of Debian images in stock, but thought I'd see what else was out there. the site's not too helpful in that regard :(
[2016-05-25 00:55:25 -0500] [vvande in #debian] I haven't tried VirtualBox before - perhaps it can use the net installer - I'll have to have a read
[2016-05-25 00:56:13 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: well it's dead simple to install debian without gnome. of course virtualbox can use the net installer, it's a CD that you boot like any other, and downloads packages from the network to install
[2016-05-25 00:56:25 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vvande: https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual  <-- worth a read
[2016-05-25 00:56:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] nah i'm not going to ignore you
[2016-05-25 00:57:25 -0500] [vvande in #debian] jmcnaught: thanks for the confirmation. That's what I needed. I've just pulled out a CD with that on it. So will go ahead and try that as my first Virtual machine.
[2016-05-25 00:57:32 -0500] [vvande in #debian] wish me luck :)
[2016-05-25 01:06:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian] do most of you compile caja-dropbox ?
[2016-05-25 01:06:53 -0500] [avis- in #debian] on jessie that is
[2016-05-25 01:10:08 -0500] [lxsameer in #debian] is there any kernel image with AUFS support ?
[2016-05-25 01:13:29 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] avis-: is there a version that will work with the version of MATE in jessie?
[2016-05-25 01:13:51 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] lxsameer: my stock kernel in jessie has an aufs module
[2016-05-25 01:14:25 -0500] [avis- in #debian] i have not tested the official dropbox deb that could possibly be latest
[2016-05-25 01:16:35 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] avis-: does caja have the spatial mode from old gnome 2 nautilus?

[2016-05-25 02:51:04 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] When using docker I read " current debian jessie does not support kernel memory limitation" -> is this true?
[2016-05-25 02:52:38 -0500] [jelly in #debian] nindustries: if you can figure out which specific feature that is, maybe someone can look it up
[2016-05-25 02:53:03 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED I suppose
[2016-05-25 02:53:21 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] I did add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="console=ttyS1,9600 cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"
[2016-05-25 02:54:26 -0500] [jelly in #debian] nindustries: grep CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED /boot/config-*
[2016-05-25 02:55:45 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] m
[2016-05-25 02:55:53 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] How do I add this in a good way?
[2016-05-25 02:56:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian] no way around building your own kernel
[2016-05-25 02:58:22 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] sigh.
[2016-05-25 02:58:27 -0500] [nindustries in #debian] Does ubuntu have this?
[2016-05-25 03:16:47 -0500] [jeeger in #debian] Greetings! My jessie server has recently taken to starting two competing openvpn processes, with one being left over after systemctl stop openvpn. Why could this be?
[2016-05-25 03:24:03 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] can i somehow automate debian install from network boot?
[2016-05-25 03:25:09 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] PXE + preseed
[2016-05-25 03:25:34 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] But it requires that you have more or less full control over the network, etc.
[2016-05-25 03:27:00 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i dont have the latter
[2016-05-25 03:27:47 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] Then PXE is not for you.
[2016-05-25 03:28:20 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] But you can still boot the netinst iso and specify a preseed file, but then you're doing 90% of the job anyway.
[2016-05-25 03:35:41 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] okay
[2016-05-25 03:44:08 -0500] [unborn in #debian] morning all.. guys is debian-update-8.4.0-amd64-CD-8.iso normal iso or its just updated files so I would have to download normal iso with it?
[2016-05-25 03:44:44 -0500] [babilen in #debian] Normal for what?
[2016-05-25 03:45:18 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] I'm going to guess it contains the changes from 8.3.0 to 8.4.0
[2016-05-25 03:45:41 -0500] [babilen in #debian] You don't want those for a new installation, but for, well, updates from an older release
[2016-05-25 03:45:56 -0500] [babilen in #debian] No idea what is "normal" though ;)
[2016-05-25 03:46:15 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] If you have a network connection you want to use the netinst image.
[2016-05-25 03:47:13 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: installation :)
[2016-05-25 03:48:13 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: so I would just download   debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso for standard net install?
[2016-05-25 03:49:05 -0500] [unborn in #debian] why I am asking those idiotic questions.. ah yay sorry :)
[2016-05-25 03:52:50 -0500] [babilen in #debian] dpkg: firmware image
[2016-05-25 03:52:51 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Unofficial <netinst> images - containing non-free Debian <firmware> packages - for installing Debian 8 "Jessie" are available from http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/ .  See also <install guide>.
[2016-05-25 03:53:01 -0500] [babilen in #debian] unborn: You might want to use ^^ if your hardware requires firmware
[2016-05-25 03:53:02 -0500] [Cloudwalker42 in #debian] hey somone can help my with mailman. The only thing I want to do is to output every mailinglist which is configured
[2016-05-25 03:54:30 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] is it possible to retrieve serial number and set hostname to that?
[2016-05-25 03:56:27 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: yeah I know them but I like to install drivers manually. Last time I tried to install iso with cinnamon, everything went smooth except that upon finishing install in point after grub install prior removing live user etc.. it froze. I guess the best way would be install normal standard iso and then add dirvers manually. I also discovered last night only that gnome 3 on debian just work as I would like to. Last time Ive installed debian with gui
[2016-05-25 03:56:27 -0500] [unborn in #debian] was debian 6.. since then I always used only without gui.
[2016-05-25 03:57:13 -0500] [unborn in #debian] what makes me wonder is the number 1, 2, 3 etc aka debian-8.4.0-amd64-DVD-2.iso - I guess that is full iso but just named differently
[2016-05-25 03:57:33 -0500] [babilen in #debian] unborn: Drivers are normally in the kernel .. there is no need to install them manually. The only bit that might be missing is the firmware that has been removed from Debian kernel packages.
[2016-05-25 03:58:31 -0500] [babilen in #debian] unborn: The entire DVD/CD/BD sets contain every single package in Debian main. You only need CD1, DVD1 or BD1 for the installation if you don't want to use the netinstall. The installer is the same on all images (modulo some settings) and they simply differ in the packages they contain.
[2016-05-25 03:58:46 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: ah.. well usually wifi does not work.. rest is working usually perfect.. I am always trying to avoid nvidia or amd graphics.. intel just works fine all the times
[2016-05-25 03:58:49 -0500] [babilen in #debian] If you are fine just downloading packages during the installation I'd just use the netinstall
[2016-05-25 03:59:15 -0500] [babilen in #debian] unborn: Sure, just saying that *iff* your hardware requires firmware that it might be easier to use the image that comes with firmware right away
[2016-05-25 04:00:19 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: ah finally I understand what those numbers are.. I was guessing that they may be a bit different as size of the dvds is various. Thank you. I stay with netinstall for simplicity :)
[2016-05-25 04:02:25 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: yeah thank you! I am going to try http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/8.4.0-live+nonfree/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-8.4.0-amd64-standard+nonfree.iso which should be netinstall
[2016-05-25 04:02:37 -0500] [unborn in #debian] babilen: thank you for your help
[2016-05-25 04:02:44 -0500] [babilen in #debian] That's the live image, I wouldn't personally use those for installation
[2016-05-25 04:03:30 -0500] [babilen in #debian] http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/firmware-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso is what I'd use
[2016-05-25 04:03:36 -0500] [babilen in #debian] http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/
[2016-05-25 04:05:35 -0500] [unborn in #debian] heh

[2016-05-25 04:09:23 -0500] [mase2hotUK in #debian] I'm using sendmail via php mail. Looking at mailq total requests it seems to be more than the amount of emails I have sent. Anyone know why this would be?
[2016-05-25 04:24:31 -0500] [topi` in #debian] any folks using the Catalyst driver with Jessie? it seems it is no longer possible to compile the Catalyst kernel driver from source because of some GPL patch backported
[2016-05-25 04:27:57 -0500] [topi` in #debian] it *was* possible a while ago to compile the Catalyst driver to suit one's kernel, but it seems no longer so. And we cannot use the vanilla 3.16 debian patched kernel because there is a regression with the rt2800 driver
[2016-05-25 04:30:15 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] how can i remove grub from appearing on boot?
[2016-05-25 04:31:24 -0500] [vegardx in #debian] You mean, how can I boot without a boot loader?
[2016-05-25 04:33:59 -0500] [hyppiebyte in #debian] He wants.to hide it because speed up the boot?
[2016-05-25 04:34:28 -0500] [unborn in #debian] AlexPortable: I would be also interested in that
[2016-05-25 04:34:32 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i dont want users to mess with it
[2016-05-25 04:34:37 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] it's for a thin client setup
[2016-05-25 04:35:25 -0500] [antzero in #debian] ^ I'm interested in this too
[2016-05-25 04:40:24 -0500] [unborn in #debian] AlexPortable: maybe this one helps: http://askubuntu.com/questions/111085/how-do-i-hide-the-grub-menu-showing-up-in-the-beginning-of-boot
[2016-05-25 04:40:56 -0500] [unborn in #debian] im going to try this once I finish install which is in 50% now..
[2016-05-25 04:52:16 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] Anyone here?
[2016-05-25 04:52:53 -0500] [hyppiebyte in #debian] Nope. We all are bots
[2016-05-25 04:52:54 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] How can I let Debian support touch screen on my tablet?
[2016-05-25 04:53:05 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] lol
[2016-05-25 04:53:49 -0500] [mati in #debian] What do you mean by "let Debian" ?
[2016-05-25 04:54:55 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] Grammar mistake, I mean:how can I use touch screen on Debian
[2016-05-25 04:55:29 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] SagelessFox2: You want to enable touch screen support on your tablet in Debian?
[2016-05-25 04:55:38 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] Yes
[2016-05-25 04:55:47 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] SagelessFox2: What is the make and model of the tablet?
[2016-05-25 04:57:15 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] Ah, I'll look up the data in details after I come home
[2016-05-25 04:58:24 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] unborn: thanks
[2016-05-25 04:58:27 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] grub_timeout = 0 helped
[2016-05-25 05:00:42 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] SagelessFox2: well we cant help you if you dont tell us the model of the tablet.
[2016-05-25 05:03:38 -0500] [chele in #debian] how do i give different width to different columns when searching with aptitude?
[2016-05-25 05:09:53 -0500] [unborn in #debian] AlexPortable: great.. Im going to do the same for my server
[2016-05-25 05:15:37 -0500] [hyppiebyte in #debian] AlexPortable: depending on the grub version you can hide the grub prompt too. It will eventually get deprecated.

[2016-05-25 05:31:43 -0500] [dionysus69 in #debian] if I set nginx worker_processes to more than 1 on a single core/ single threaded vm, does it make a difference?
[2016-05-25 05:43:56 -0500] [dionysus69 in #debian] I have only default actions defined and created by scaffolding which are these: only: [:show, :update, :destroy] but then I can go to the route and I can view indexed items as well as create a record. The record creates with attributes set to null though.
[2016-05-25 05:44:48 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] plasmoduck: In windows device manager,  the touch screen is "KMDF HID minidriver for Touch I2C Device"
[2016-05-25 05:45:10 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] I asked the engineer of the firm
[2016-05-25 05:45:34 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] He said the touch screen is the same as IPad air :|
[2016-05-25 05:46:23 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] The model is teclast x98 Plus
[2016-05-25 05:46:33 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] X86 based tablet
[2016-05-25 05:47:16 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] So the question is: how to use touchscreen on my tablet in Debian
[2016-05-25 05:47:50 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] :|
[2016-05-25 05:47:52 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] SagelessFox2: Intel Atom X5 processer?
[2016-05-25 05:48:06 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] Yes
[2016-05-25 05:49:32 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] SagelessFox2: You could try to install the i2c-tools package.
[2016-05-25 05:49:36 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] See if that helps.
[2016-05-25 05:54:18 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] hypermist: grub prompt?
[2016-05-25 05:54:45 -0500] [SagelessFox2 in #debian] OK, thanks  plasmoduck
[2016-05-25 05:56:47 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] AlexPortable, huh ?
[2016-05-25 05:57:05 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] sorry i meant hyppiebyte
[2016-05-25 05:57:17 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] I was like WAAAAAAAAT xDD
[2016-05-25 05:58:36 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i noticedx dd
[2016-05-25 06:05:34 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Goooooood afternooon, good people
[2016-05-25 06:09:13 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] how can i install citrix?
[2016-05-25 06:09:35 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] dpkg -i icaclient.deb fails because ia32-libs is not installed
[2016-05-25 06:09:35 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] installs icaclient.deb fails because ia32-libs is not installed into alexportable's head with a bone saw and a few screws
[2016-05-25 06:09:56 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] also it needs lib32asound2 and nspluginwrapper
[2016-05-25 06:22:26 -0500] [Gv3s7ACK in #debian] Hi
[2016-05-25 06:25:18 -0500] [MeanEYE in #debian] Hi.
[2016-05-25 06:26:45 -0500] [Gv3s7ACK in #debian] How are you guys?
[2016-05-25 06:29:37 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] step 1) find the cheapest hw you can geneate a broadcast tv signal with http://hackaday.com/2016/03/01/color-tv-broadcasts-are-esp8266s-newest-trick/
[2016-05-25 06:30:50 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] AlexPortable: package requiring ia32-libs = a package that isn't staying current, and probably should be avoided YMMV.  (also, seems popular with proprietary software... related?  I wonder...)
[2016-05-25 06:31:08 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] ah
[2016-05-25 06:31:11 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] ymmv?
[2016-05-25 06:31:30 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] sorry.  Your Milage May Vary.  <- you may have different results
[2016-05-25 06:33:19 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] okay
[2016-05-25 06:34:45 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] jelly: Ah, the upper sideband. And every other harmonic
[2016-05-25 06:35:17 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] step 2) find the cheapest hw you can generate an _arbitrary_ signal with
[2016-05-25 06:35:31 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] That's not an arbitary signal
[2016-05-25 06:35:44 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] Also, did you mean the arbitary signal up to some nyquist limit?
[2016-05-25 06:36:38 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] information theory is for wimps, transfer all the gigabits?
[2016-05-25 06:37:38 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] jelly: Actually, I feel that cake is easier
[2016-05-25 06:38:00 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] jarick: I was thinking more in the lines of "can we make an analog PAL or digital DVB encoder for 1/10 commercial price or less)
[2016-05-25 06:38:37 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] jelly: Probably not
[2016-05-25 06:38:42 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] Not especially with the DVB
[2016-05-25 06:38:44 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] Dont know, but it may be possible with advance DSP chip.
[2016-05-25 06:39:29 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] jarick: a fixed image, 2005 http://www.bellard.org/dvbt/
[2016-05-25 06:39:36 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] However, http://www.idealez.com/hides/product-detail/en_US/75595
[2016-05-25 06:40:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] but yeah, that's f.bellard
[2016-05-25 06:43:07 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] an immediate goal was to reenable a half-broken local cable system in the building, and add a couple custom channels.  $185 isn't bad.
[2016-05-25 06:47:38 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] BroadcastMeOwnTVShow?
[2016-05-25 06:48:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: more like "want to see who's at the door on my tv"
[2016-05-25 06:48:52 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] your tv has a door?
[2016-05-25 06:49:26 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] the building door (does not yet, but) might have a camera
[2016-05-25 06:49:54 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] the tv sometimes has.  The Scary Door.
[2016-05-25 06:51:05 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian-offtopic] yo Chikoritas and Nachos...good morning to my fellas in US
[2016-05-25 06:52:15 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] ah
[2016-05-25 06:52:30 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] my building also has a door
[2016-05-25 06:52:52 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] jelly: There might be broadcast regs
[2016-05-25 06:53:00 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] And spectrum use regs
[2016-05-25 06:53:10 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] but recording public places is quite strictly regulated here
[2016-05-25 06:53:31 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian-offtopic] like Google Glass???
[2016-05-25 06:55:41 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I think that's different because a human controls it
[2016-05-25 06:56:07 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I dunno the exact regulations... I should look them up
[2016-05-25 06:58:20 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] AlexPortable, openxenmanager is in the debian repos... but the version there is too old
[2016-05-25 06:58:28 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] judd, versions openxenmanager
[2016-05-25 06:58:29 -0500] [judd in #debian] Package: openxenmanager on amd64 -- jessie: 0.r80+dfsg-4; sid: 0.r80+dfsg-4; wheezy: 0.r80+dfsg-4; stretch: 0.r80+dfsg-4
[2016-05-25 06:58:31 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] openxenmanager?
[2016-05-25 06:58:37 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i need receiver
[2016-05-25 06:58:42 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] but i think i fixed it with web client
[2016-05-25 06:59:11 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] openxenmanager is the only thing citrix I ever had a need for... or heard about
[2016-05-25 07:00:08 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] mixing .deb packages from other people into debian often turns out to be a bad idea... often it's better to compile from source
[2016-05-25 07:00:17 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] there are always regs
[2016-05-25 07:01:05 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] AlexPortable, and even if you do it... after you do dpkg -i xxx.deb, you have to run apt-get -f install or aptitude -f install
[2016-05-25 07:01:10 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] to pull in missing dependencies
[2016-05-25 07:01:30 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian-offtopic] hey guys are there any cpp chans in freenode??
[2016-05-25 07:01:36 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] but the building is privately owned, I guess if we're very very careful not to point the cam at the side of the street we might be lucky enough not to have to deal with that
[2016-05-25 07:01:38 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] if this is 32 bit, you may have to enable multiarch, too...
[2016-05-25 07:01:42 -0500] [rsc in #debian] How do I file a bug report against a Debian software? ;)
[2016-05-25 07:01:57 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] ,v reportbug
[2016-05-25 07:01:58 -0500] [judd in #debian] Package: reportbug on amd64 -- squeeze: 4.12.6; squeeze-security-lts: 4.12.6+deb6u1; wheezy: 6.4.4+deb7u1; wheezy-security: 6.4.4+deb7u1; jessie: 6.6.3; jessie-backports: 6.6.6~bpo8+1; sid: 6.6.6; stretch: 6.6.6
[2016-05-25 07:02:55 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] teraflops, that's not - as such - an answer, but a command to the bot
[2016-05-25 07:03:12 -0500] [rsc in #debian] Fedora has a Bugzilla, Debian doesn't seem to have one.
[2016-05-25 07:03:37 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: I didnt issue the command for you
[2016-05-25 07:03:50 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] I know...
[2016-05-25 07:03:54 -0500] [abrotman in #debian-offtopic] MaBunny: ##c++ probably
[2016-05-25 07:04:04 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] rsc, just type reportbug on the command line and follow instructions
[2016-05-25 07:04:08 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian-offtopic] ok
[2016-05-25 07:04:11 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] well go help rsc instead talking to me
[2016-05-25 07:04:43 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] rsc, can be a bit more complicated if your machine cannot send mail directly
[2016-05-25 07:04:45 -0500] [rsc in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: ush, then e-mail headers from a customer system are public...not an option.
[2016-05-25 07:04:51 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] rsc, the stuff then goes to bugs.debian.org
[2016-05-25 07:05:19 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] rsc, read manpage. you can export to a file and send copy that into a mail of your liking
[2016-05-25 07:05:43 -0500] [rsc in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: Debian is complicated :(
[2016-05-25 07:06:13 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] smtp isn't more complicated than http
[2016-05-25 07:06:16 -0500] [AudacityFailure in #debian] Audacity crashes and audio distortion on Jessie. Unable to find cause, unsure whether building the latest version from source is a wise decision
[2016-05-25 07:07:08 -0500] [rsc in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: it is, because it gathers information from the system, more as needed.
[2016-05-25 07:07:22 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] then truncate it
[2016-05-25 07:08:08 -0500] [rsc in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: did you mean reportbug --output=XXX?
[2016-05-25 07:08:10 -0500] [leolas in #debian] ls
[2016-05-25 07:08:49 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] I look in the manpage when I use it
[2016-05-25 07:09:55 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] but yeah
[2016-05-25 07:10:13 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] don't use --offline, though
[2016-05-25 07:10:39 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] and stop worrying so much... it's quite transparent as such
[2016-05-25 07:11:00 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] my main gripe with it is that it publishes your email, so take some spam-trap to send it from
[2016-05-25 07:11:41 -0500] [rsc in #debian] That is another issue, yes. Which is better solved at e.g. bugzilla
[2016-05-25 07:13:59 -0500] [AudacityFailure in #debian] Attempting to build audacity from source, build-deps have conflicts with packages I need, Jessie. https://paste.debian.net/702556/
[2016-05-25 07:14:59 -0500] [rsc in #debian] Ah, was already filed: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=811481 - but still unfixed :(
[2016-05-25 07:15:00 -0500] [judd in #debian] Bug http://bugs.debian.org/811481 in ovirt-guest-agent (open): «ovirt-guest-agent service still doesn't start»; severity: important; opened: 2016-01-19; last modified: 2016-04-11.
[2016-05-25 07:18:11 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] I knew that would happen
[2016-05-25 07:18:27 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] and that's the reason you should use reportbug :)
[2016-05-25 07:19:15 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] it's somewhat good at preventing duplicates
[2016-05-25 07:20:16 -0500] [rsc in #debian] CutMeOwnThroat: this is not an exclusive feature of reportbug, but works also in Bugzilla ;-)
[2016-05-25 07:20:21 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] jelly,  but broadcasting open tv signals of your camera to the closer vicinity?
[2016-05-25 07:20:39 -0500] [rsc in #debian] More sad thing is that it's not fixed for months through.
[2016-05-25 07:21:17 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] although, to be fair, the neighbors can probably see who's at your door through their window
[2016-05-25 07:21:26 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] it just feels weird
[2016-05-25 07:33:52 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Oh boy, lousy wlan is lousy
[2016-05-25 07:34:14 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Most integrators can't do wifi
[2016-05-25 07:34:28 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: broadcasting into our internal network
[2016-05-25 07:34:45 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] not that broad
[2016-05-25 07:34:46 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] hm
[2016-05-25 07:35:13 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Wifi is newland
[2016-05-25 07:35:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] cable network that is.
[2016-05-25 07:35:49 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] cables rock
[2016-05-25 07:35:56 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] rf antenna cable
[2016-05-25 07:36:51 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: there may or may not be illegal broadcasting of ponies on a test channel
[2016-05-25 07:37:14 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] jelly: They started showing MLP here.
[2016-05-25 07:37:24 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] ~yay
[2016-05-25 07:37:26 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] For some reason they felt the need to censor a lot of it before broadcast
[2016-05-25 07:38:08 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] apparently the cider episode was not 'casted in UK at all because ALCOHOL

[2016-05-25 08:00:32 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Hey, I just installed debian for my client. He asked me to install LXDE, Apache and basic-linux-utilities when asked. But I forgot about basic linux utilities(or whatever it was called in the menu). So how do I install it post installation?
[2016-05-25 08:02:19 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, there is no package named basic-linux-utilities
[2016-05-25 08:02:45 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: It was something similar to that. it is not the exact name.
[2016-05-25 08:03:01 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, even so
[2016-05-25 08:03:02 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: If I remember correctly, it was option no. 11
[2016-05-25 08:03:19 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] there is some basic packages but they should be already installed.
[2016-05-25 08:03:20 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] archer121: are you talking about build-essential ?
[2016-05-25 08:03:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] archer121: tasksel --task-packages standard

[2016-05-25 08:04:47 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, for example, coreutils
[2016-05-25 08:04:59 -0500] [Tommeh in #debian] Hello everyone. Out of interest, do we have a Holger Levson lurking here?
[2016-05-25 08:05:18 -0500] [gmh in #debian] is back (gone 00:00:05)
[2016-05-25 08:05:41 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Nope, guyz, I had to use the non-gui method. So after configuring apt, I was given a mist of softwares to install. I was doing a netinstall
[2016-05-25 08:05:55 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] So there was this option no 11.
[2016-05-25 08:06:09 -0500] [markybob in #debian] archer121: right. i answered your question.
[2016-05-25 08:07:35 -0500] [markybob in #debian] archer121: keep it simple then. just sudo tasksel
[2016-05-25 08:08:04 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] markybob: And I get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/16679973/ (first command)
[2016-05-25 08:09:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] archer121: looks like you have everything to me
[2016-05-25 08:10:05 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, trust me, there is not such package.
[2016-05-25 08:10:12 -0500] [themill in #debian] Tommeh: no; best to just ask your question
[2016-05-25 08:10:22 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, linux is the kernel, that name has no sense.
[2016-05-25 08:10:34 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: Alright. Thanks.

[2016-05-25 08:11:21 -0500] [atracht in #debian] hi, I'm having issues getting nfs server working on jessie, it will work initially on install but on any reboot, even after running service restart it won't showup under rpcinfo, no errors
[2016-05-25 08:12:36 -0500] [donnoc in #debian] how can I check which file system I am on? like NTFS or ext2-3
[2016-05-25 08:13:04 -0500] [themill in #debian] donnoc: the output of "mount"
[2016-05-25 08:14:13 -0500] [donnoc in #debian] themill: thank you
[2016-05-25 08:14:21 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] atracht, what is the status of the service?
[2016-05-25 08:15:26 -0500] [atracht in #debian] Brigo when I run service nfs-kernel-server start I don't get any errors
[2016-05-25 08:15:51 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] atracht, systemctl status nfs-kernel-server, if you are using systemd, please.
[2016-05-25 08:18:11 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: I found it. http://www.linuxjournal.com/ufiles/debian_netinstall.png I forgot to install "Satndard System". Now what can I do?
[2016-05-25 08:18:39 -0500] [atracht in #debian] Brigo apologies, I don't have the machine on hand at the moment, I'll have to check that later, appreciate the help, what should the status say?
[2016-05-25 08:19:04 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: It should be "Satndard System Tools"
[2016-05-25 08:19:21 -0500] [Tommeh in #debian] themill: ah, no question as such - Holger is meant to be here at RIPE72 in Copenhagen, but I might miss the talk itself. Wanted to see if we could catch-up beforehand :)
[2016-05-25 08:19:26 -0500] [Tommeh in #debian] (in person, as it were)
[2016-05-25 08:19:38 -0500] [Tommeh in #debian] Not to worry though. Will scour some meeting badges.
[2016-05-25 08:20:09 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] archer121, i don't know i haven't that option in my system
[2016-05-25 08:20:15 -0500] [archer121 in #debian] Brigo: It is standard system utilities. https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcROAmQod0NtGWJgZNuD57dW2YoKy4I7yK3TZ8V14iuuxqG8yEaQ
[2016-05-25 08:20:40 -0500] [themill in #debian] archer121: "tasksel install standard" if you really want all of them
[2016-05-25 08:23:44 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] atracht, Active: active (running), but i have never used nfs, so i man not an expert.
[2016-05-25 08:24:32 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] atracht, but systemctl status should be a good start. Then you can check logs with journalctl -b (for checking logs from the boot)
[2016-05-25 08:24:50 -0500] [atracht in #debian] Brigo thanks!
[2016-05-25 08:25:06 -0500] [Brigo in #debian] atracht, yw. :)

[2016-05-25 08:39:45 -0500] [markybob in #debian] zalun: so you're not even using debian. ask #ubuntu
[2016-05-25 08:39:56 -0500] [zalun in #debian] right :)
[2016-05-25 08:39:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !ubuntu
[2016-05-25 08:39:58 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it is not Debian.  Only Debian is supported on #debian.  Use #ubuntu on chat.freenode.net instead.  Even if the channel happens to be less helpful, support for distributions other than Debian is offtopic on #debian.  See also <based on debian> and <ubuntuirc>.
[2016-05-25 08:45:42 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] what is the recommended frequency for updating/upgrading?
[2016-05-25 08:47:04 -0500] [jelly in #debian] snfgf: subscribe to debian-security-announce and debian-announce, and track changes relevant to your systems on a daily basis
[2016-05-25 08:49:12 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] jelly, okay, so i should not put update/upgrade in crontab?
[2016-05-25 08:50:21 -0500] [markybob in #debian] snfgf: on a stable system this should be okay https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades
[2016-05-25 08:50:35 -0500] [markybob in #debian] snfgf: if you have mixed repos don't even think about it

[2016-05-25 09:01:59 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] pzn, losetup --find --show --partscan file.img and then /dev/loopXpY
[2016-05-25 09:03:13 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] or partx/kpartx which creates partition devices under /dev/mapper/

[2016-05-25 11:38:08 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] cause my nagios broke also
[2016-05-25 11:38:14 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] the init file also broke
[2016-05-25 11:38:22 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] there is only a "30" in the file
[2016-05-25 11:38:27 -0500] [amcorreia in #debian] there is a number at first line?
[2016-05-25 11:38:34 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] yes

[2016-05-25 11:39:40 -0500] [babilen in #debian] So, just run "service apache2 restart" or use systemctl

[2016-05-25 11:43:10 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] I rebooted I did n ot do the link stuff let me read
[2016-05-25 11:43:21 -0500] [babilen in #debian] afernandez_: It is "systemctl status apache2.service" and "journalctl -xn"
[2016-05-25 11:43:33 -0500] [babilen in #debian] (status before apache2.service)
[2016-05-25 11:44:10 -0500] [babilen in #debian] afernandez_: In particular you have to pay attention to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html linked in there
[2016-05-25 11:44:46 -0500] [markybob in #debian] afernandez_: apache 2.4 upgrade breaks very badly. it'll be a painful day. that's why you should read the release notes before upgrading
[2016-05-25 11:45:50 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] may unisntalled and install ? this a test box for nagios
[2016-05-25 11:45:55 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Nagios broke also
[2016-05-25 11:50:57 -0500] [MaxxterEXE in #debian] Someone have a solution for me? I want a Simple GUI that only needs to run virtual machines
[2016-05-25 11:51:28 -0500] [markybob in #debian] MaxxterEXE: xfce is pretty simple/light
[2016-05-25 11:51:51 -0500] [MaxxterEXE in #debian] xfce wrote that one down Thanks
[2016-05-25 11:52:28 -0500] [MaxxterEXE in #debian] More suggestions?
[2016-05-25 11:55:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] MaxxterEXE: lxde fits what you asked for and isn't bad. i prefer xfce though.
[2016-05-25 11:56:50 -0500] [n1md4 in #debian] hi.  is it easily possible to put some files on a live linux usb stick?
[2016-05-25 11:57:47 -0500] [_0bitcount in #debian] MaxxterEXE, fluxbox or Openbox.
[2016-05-25 11:57:56 -0500] [Gaiseric in #debian] n1md4: Definitely possible, BUT it depends on how the USB stick was created/formatted
[2016-05-25 11:58:26 -0500] [n1md4 in #debian] Gaiseric: the standard debian live iso... so i guess not witout some prior modding in some way ..
[2016-05-25 11:58:28 -0500] [Gaiseric in #debian] There are several methods, some manual, some automated. Generally it is possible though
[2016-05-25 11:59:04 -0500] [Gaiseric in #debian] No idea about the standard one :(
[2016-05-25 11:59:21 -0500] [n1md4 in #debian] okay, well, i'll ask big brother
[2016-05-25 11:59:38 -0500] [n1md4 in #debian] Thanks.
[2016-05-25 12:04:24 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] Hey Guys!
[2016-05-25 12:05:13 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] I have a physical server with IP 172.18.8.7 configured for the physical interface. I also have a virtual interface in my server. 172.18.8.8
[2016-05-25 12:05:54 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] when I do ssh to another server, I have 172.18.8.7 allowed, but in auth.log appears as 8.8, what can I do so that ssh connects giving the physical address as source address?
[2016-05-25 12:06:55 -0500] [socomm in #debian] dimitry7: What does 'route -n' give you?
[2016-05-25 12:06:56 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] dimitry7: bind ssh to 172.18.8.7
[2016-05-25 12:07:18 -0500] [Gaiseric in #debian] !dpkg
[2016-05-25 12:07:18 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] extra, extra, read all about it, dpkg is the program used by Debian to install and remove packages, "man dpkg".  Also ask me about <reference>.  The main info bot in #debian is also called dpkg; ask me about <dpkgbot>.
[2016-05-25 12:07:19 -0500] [socomm in #debian] ChrisH: s/he is trying to ssh to another server (if I'm reading correctly)
[2016-05-25 12:07:27 -0500] [Gaiseric in #debian] !dmo
[2016-05-25 12:07:27 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] We recommend against using deb-multimedia.org; these unofficial packages are known to cause many hard to debug problems.  They are not in Debian either because the they are poor in quality or for legal reasons.  See http://deb-multimedia.org/ or ask me about <dmm wheezy>, <dmm jessie>.  See also <dmm list>, <dmm mirrors>, <dmm pinning>, <why not dmm>, <dmm remove>.
[2016-05-25 12:07:57 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] dimitry7: man sshd_config ListenAddress   will set this IP as sender IP
[2016-05-25 12:08:09 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] socomm, this is route -n: http://paste.debian.net/703195/
[2016-05-25 12:08:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Gaiseric: you can /msg the bot for yourself
[2016-05-25 12:08:15 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] chris1-, is it possible?
[2016-05-25 12:08:23 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] oohh, great ChrisH
[2016-05-25 12:08:27 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] let me do it! :)
[2016-05-25 12:08:28 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] socomm: yes. I understood his request  and this is the easiest way to fix it
[2016-05-25 12:09:09 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] socomm,dimitry7 Offline.
[2016-05-25 12:10:59 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] ChrisH, ListenAddress 172.18.8.7
[2016-05-25 12:11:09 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] and still it connects as 8.8 :(
[2016-05-25 12:13:19 -0500] [socomm in #debian] I'm not sure ChrisH understood the question, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.
[2016-05-25 12:14:11 -0500] [socomm in #debian] You are connecting from host A to host B - B shows you connecting from IP add 172.18.8.8, when you should be connecting 172.18.8.7, correct?
[2016-05-25 12:14:22 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] socomm, yes correct
[2016-05-25 12:14:30 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] 8.7 is physical, 8.8 is virtual
[2016-05-25 12:16:05 -0500] [socomm in #debian] You could try adding a static route so that any traffic to 172.18.8.0 subnet uses 172.18.8.7
[2016-05-25 12:16:18 -0500] [socomm in #debian] http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/configuring-static-routes-in-debian-or-red-hat-linux-systems.html
[2016-05-25 12:16:32 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] socomm, no, I have other servers in the 172.18.8.0/22 segment
[2016-05-25 12:16:41 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] everyone uses a different IP address
[2016-05-25 12:17:51 -0500] [socomm in #debian] dimitry7: The easiest would be allow access from 172.18.8.8 ... or add static route to host B
[2016-05-25 12:18:46 -0500] [socomm in #debian] something like 'ip route add 172.18.8.<ssh server bit> via 172.18.8.7 dev eth0'
[2016-05-25 12:19:56 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] socomm, ok ok
[2016-05-25 12:20:03 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] I'll allow access for 8.8 too
[2016-05-25 12:20:04 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] :)
[2016-05-25 12:20:11 -0500] [dimitry7 in #debian] thank you socomm !!

[2016-05-25 12:22:33 -0500] [antzero in #debian] How do one install a missing driver on debian? I had the error during the install and skipped it
[2016-05-25 12:22:40 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I know for sure it's in the non-free repo
[2016-05-25 12:23:02 -0500] [antzero in #debian] I just add non-free in sources.list and run apt-get upgrade? it will automatically install the missing driver?
[2016-05-25 12:23:39 -0500] [unborn in #debian] antzero: apt-get update and then install what is missing
[2016-05-25 12:24:03 -0500] [antzero in #debian] apt will automatically install it? or I have to specify the package?
[2016-05-25 12:24:20 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] try it and report bakc
[2016-05-25 12:24:39 -0500] [unborn in #debian] antzero: you should specify.. if you have no idea what you need to install then install this: http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/jessie/current/firmware.zip
[2016-05-25 12:24:51 -0500] [antzero in #debian] the problem is that the missing driver is the network card
[2016-05-25 12:25:08 -0500] [antzero in #debian] so I have to download the deb from another computer and then install it with dpkg?
[2016-05-25 12:25:55 -0500] [unborn in #debian] antzero: sorry! this one have it all in https://packages.debian.org/jessie/all/firmware-linux-nonfree/download
[2016-05-25 12:26:22 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] I need to download a .pem certificate, but in iceweasel, the CA is intercepting the connection and not even displaying the actuall PGP cert text- just a window that says "this certificate is already installed as a certificate authority". Is there a workaround?
[2016-05-25 12:26:31 -0500] [unborn in #debian] antzero: if you dont have internet on that machine then yes..
[2016-05-25 12:26:40 -0500] [antzero in #debian] Perfect, will do
[2016-05-25 12:27:42 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] sorry- to be more clear, I need the text file saved on my system in order to point a .conf file towards it
[2016-05-25 12:28:49 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] countbackula: does wget or crul correctly download the file?
[2016-05-25 12:29:01 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] countbackula: also is there a way to click 'save as' vs just click on the link to download it
[2016-05-25 12:29:48 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] somiaj: even if I right click the link the error window pops up
[2016-05-25 12:30:05 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] somiaj: let me check my curl version
[2016-05-25 12:31:45 -0500] [antzero in #debian] worked perfectly
[2016-05-25 12:37:25 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] somiaj: so turns out wget and curl were hanging up when using IVP6, but works when I use an IPV4 flag. thanks for the tip!

[2016-05-25 12:50:44 -0500] [fennesz in #debian] Hello ! I am having high cpu usage when watching videos on youtube . I have 2 gpus (one intel and one nvidia ) on an asus n56jr laptop . Can someone help?
[2016-05-25 12:56:40 -0500] [radian in #debian] Is it a bad idea to install video card drivers from a bash file?
[2016-05-25 12:56:53 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] hola
[2016-05-25 12:57:01 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] alguien ha conectado la kinect2 en debian jessie ?
[2016-05-25 12:57:42 -0500] [markybob in #debian] radian: it's an awful idea and it will break your debian system during the next kernel upgrade or xorg upgrade. don't do it
[2016-05-25 12:57:57 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] it's probably a bad idea to install video card drivers from unknown sources, yes...
[2016-05-25 12:58:17 -0500] [radian in #debian] I am trying to install amd drivers for debian 8
[2016-05-25 12:59:20 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] radian: https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo
[2016-05-25 12:59:43 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i was going to tell him to be specific...that told us nothing
[2016-05-25 13:02:47 -0500] [radian in #debian] does debian use KDE 5?
[2016-05-25 13:03:15 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] radian: wich build are you referring to?
[2016-05-25 13:03:29 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] Jessie?
[2016-05-25 13:03:31 -0500] [radian in #debian] 8.4
[2016-05-25 13:04:22 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] radian: yes
[2016-05-25 13:04:44 -0500] [antzero in #debian] oh, on a side note, the zip pack of all non-free firmware are dependent of the version of debian? or I can install the jessie one on strech?
[2016-05-25 13:04:48 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] radian: no sorry
[2016-05-25 13:04:50 -0500] [antzero in #debian] i.e.
[2016-05-25 13:04:52 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] it doesn't
[2016-05-25 13:05:40 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] radian: only sid uses 5 iirc
[2016-05-25 13:05:57 -0500] [AfterDark in #debian] Actually, KDE 5 is in Testing.
[2016-05-25 13:06:18 -0500] [AfterDark in #debian] https://wiki.debian.org/KDE
[2016-05-25 13:06:52 -0500] [AfterDark in #debian] So, if you want KDE 5, you want Debian Stretch.
[2016-05-25 13:07:17 -0500] [radian in #debian] Is that bleeding edge?
[2016-05-25 13:07:34 -0500] [BinBasher in #debian] oh :o
[2016-05-25 13:07:34 -0500] [AfterDark in #debian] I wouldn't call Testing/Stretch bleeding edge.

[2016-05-25 13:23:20 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] What's the easiest way to create a deb package? I would like to not spend much time on configuring it if possible.
[2016-05-25 13:25:39 -0500] [mutante in #debian] thurstylark: probably to take an existing very simple package, unpack it, modify the config files and run debuild
[2016-05-25 13:26:12 -0500] [mutante in #debian] there's gonna be 10 different tools though .. /me hides
[2016-05-25 13:27:23 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] sounds good to me. Any suggestions on what package to inspect?
[2016-05-25 13:32:30 -0500] [mutante in #debian] thurstylark: something that is not a binary but just installs some files.. makes it easier. like a font package maybe
[2016-05-25 13:32:50 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] buenas muyayos :-)

[2016-05-25 14:00:11 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] I suppose there's absolutely no way to kill a process in the D state such as sync?
[2016-05-25 14:03:27 -0500] [rardiol in #debian] what's the license of debian itself?
[2016-05-25 14:05:16 -0500] [markybob in #debian] rardiol:  read https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses and https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/

[2016-05-25 14:15:59 -0500] [rardiol in #debian] markybob: ok, thanks
[2016-05-25 14:31:23 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] how can I list packages that are half configured or not completely installed?
[2016-05-25 14:31:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian] devster31: dpkg -l | grep -v '^.[^ic]'
[2016-05-25 14:32:13 -0500] [greycat in #debian] err...
[2016-05-25 14:32:41 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Take out the -v.  I double negatived myself.
[2016-05-25 14:33:45 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: ah bien, yo no recuerdo que debian tengo el contenedor de fuslvz
[2016-05-25 14:33:56 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] thanks, can I dpkg --configure <packagename> them individually?

[2016-05-25 14:34:21 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Yes, if you want.
[2016-05-25 14:34:31 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] i'm trying to salvage a dying system, it got stuck configuring kernel-bootloader updates so I'm trying to configure them manually
[2016-05-25 14:34:41 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] ah tengo wheezy x86
[2016-05-25 14:34:53 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I'd normally start with "dpkg --configure -a" and let that sort out the easy ones.
[2016-05-25 14:35:07 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] ye, that's the problem
[2016-05-25 14:35:10 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] sync doesn't work
[2016-05-25 14:35:18 -0500] [devster31 in #debian] and basically every script has multiple sync calls
[2016-05-25 14:36:53 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You mean /bin/sync from coreutils?  Really?

[2016-05-25 15:15:38 -0500] [niggard in #debian] hello, how to wget from an ssh server?
[2016-05-25 15:16:04 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You don't, obviously.
[2016-05-25 15:16:12 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You sftp or scp or ssh or sshfs-mount instead.
[2016-05-25 15:16:50 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] Coño! Hace fresco.  Hasta el 40 de mayo no te quites el sayo...
[2016-05-25 15:16:57 -0500] [tropo in #debian] assume i make a application which lists all available wireless networks. For that, I'd have to get that info from my wireless card. What's the proper way to get this information? Is there something like a service/api or whatever I can access?
[2016-05-25 15:17:17 -0500] [niggard in #debian] how to use 'ssh' to download a file?
[2016-05-25 15:17:32 -0500] [greycat in #debian] ssh user@host 'cat /the/file' > localfilename
[2016-05-25 15:17:48 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] greycat: Tricky.
[2016-05-25 15:17:57 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] niggard: does scp count?
[2016-05-25 15:18:31 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] tropo: Something like iwlist scanning
[2016-05-25 15:18:48 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] tropo: iwlist <interface> scanning
[2016-05-25 15:18:54 -0500] [niggard in #debian] thx, ssh way worked
[2016-05-25 15:18:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If it's a single file, scp is the more obvious way to do it.
[2016-05-25 15:19:37 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If this is going to be an ongoing thing, I'd sshfs mount it and then use cp and so on.
[2016-05-25 15:20:00 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] rsync
[2016-05-25 15:20:32 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Yeah, that too.  Depends on the actual task.
[2016-05-25 15:20:48 -0500] [tropo in #debian] jhutchins, I'm new to this kind of coding, but do you mean that I basically run the command via code and then save the output and do whatever I like with it? (so basically string operations?)
[2016-05-25 15:20:56 -0500] [niggard in #debian] how to mount sshfs? I tried, it didn't work via fuse or something
[2016-05-25 15:21:41 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i need a crashcourse in systemctl. my jessie box is not booting because the LVM is incomplete. well ok, i know. how do i systemctl removedep early-lvm-activation.service or something like that
[2016-05-25 15:21:51 -0500] [niggard in #debian] can I use ssh alias in /etc/fstab to mount sshfs?
[2016-05-25 15:22:11 -0500] [trysten in #debian] niggard: be more specific with the error. maybe.
[2016-05-25 15:22:27 -0500] [greycat in #debian] niggard: on which version of Debian?  In wheezy there's a fuse group you have to be in, but in jessie there is not.

[2016-05-25 15:24:02 -0500] [greycat in #debian] In jessie you just run an sshfs command.
[2016-05-25 15:24:25 -0500] [trysten in #debian] how do i remove a systemctl boot dependency? i wish my system to boot even though an LVM is "degraded" or whatever
[2016-05-25 15:25:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] niggard: sshfs isn't installed by default, btw. you probably have to apt-get install it if something else hasn't brought it in yet
[2016-05-25 15:25:18 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I installed it
[2016-05-25 15:25:24 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I failed to automount it
[2016-05-25 15:25:49 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I am not familiar with having autofs run non-root USER mount commands....
[2016-05-25 15:26:03 -0500] [greycat in #debian] sshfs is something you do as yourself, the user, not as root.
[2016-05-25 15:26:30 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Why don't you boot with a debian iso chroot into it and fix the stuff?
[2016-05-25 15:27:30 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] I am configuring a program and the docs say it will support MYSQL if the libraries are found. Configure reports MYSQL supprt: no. How do I check if I have development libraries installed?

[2016-05-25 15:28:03 -0500] [niggard in #debian] ah
[2016-05-25 15:28:09 -0500] [niggard in #debian] so that's why it doesn't work
[2016-05-25 15:28:32 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I have ssh keys as a user, not as root
[2016-05-25 15:28:45 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] greycat, find / -name "libmysqlclient-dev", is a good way to search?
[2016-05-25 15:29:04 -0500] [greycat in #debian] snfgf: gaaaah, no, just use apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev or dpkg -l libmysqlclient-dev to verify it.
[2016-05-25 15:29:18 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] locate libmysqlclient-dev
[2016-05-25 15:29:22 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] thanks
[2016-05-25 15:29:28 -0500] [niggard in #debian] teraflops: did you address your last message to me?
[2016-05-25 15:29:35 -0500] [greycat in #debian] use the package manager to verify the installation of packages
[2016-05-25 15:29:57 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] niggard: nope. It was to trysten
[2016-05-25 15:30:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] P.S. this is what I did to find the package name:  apt-cache search --names-only mysql dev
[2016-05-25 15:30:57 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] sevilla API <--
[2016-05-25 15:31:01 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Gave 11 results, and I selected the one that looked right.
[2016-05-25 15:31:35 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] tropo: Sorry, rl.  Try it and see if what you get is useful.  It's fairly common to manipulate output with awk to strip unnecessary stuff.
[2016-05-25 15:32:17 -0500] [tropo in #debian] jhutchins, Im just doing it for fun and to learn - which includes that I want to get it correct ;) but sure, thanks - it's a start. :)
[2016-05-25 15:33:13 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] tropo: cut and tr are useful for manipulating strings as well
[2016-05-25 15:33:22 -0500] [greycat in #debian] cut is almost always the wrong answer
[2016-05-25 15:34:07 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] greycat: I think I used it to grab just the ip address from ifconfig eth0 in an early personal dyndns script.
[2016-05-25 15:34:21 -0500] [greycat in #debian] jhutchins: I won't dispute that you used it, but....
[2016-05-25 15:34:41 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] greycat: There was probably a more elegant way, but I got that to work.
[2016-05-25 15:34:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] jhutchins: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/IpAddress  scroll down to the Debian example
[2016-05-25 15:35:10 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] Problem was I was posting the output to a VMS filesystem that had versioning.  Eventually, I filled up the disk and crashed the server (took a couple of years).
[2016-05-25 15:36:00 -0500] [greycat in #debian] "How do I extract my IP address from ifconfig" is a FAQ in #bash and it's a wrong question.
[2016-05-25 15:36:00 -0500] [vanwhy in #debian] ok to ask for Sid support in here?
[2016-05-25 15:36:09 -0500] [niggard in #debian] does sshfs support ssh_config aliases?
[2016-05-25 15:36:24 -0500] [greycat in #debian] It should.

[2016-05-25 15:37:46 -0500] [niggard in #debian] executing 'sshfs sshserveralias ~/mount/ssh -C -o allow_other' results into 'missing host, see `ssh -h' for usage
[2016-05-25 15:39:02 -0500] [trysten in #debian] notes that sshfs -h from wheezy prints some to stdout and some to stderr
[2016-05-25 15:39:06 -0500] [trysten in #debian] weird..
[2016-05-25 15:39:22 -0500] [trysten in #debian] niggard: looks like the colon following the host is required

[2016-05-25 15:43:45 -0500] [niggard in #debian] why do you force this abbreviation?

[2016-05-25 15:44:48 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I bet 268 of them were used by greycat :)
[2016-05-25 15:44:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] you don't usually have to tell people what it means
[2016-05-25 15:45:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] even if they don't know they can google
[2016-05-25 15:45:08 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I searched in urbandictionary
[2016-05-25 15:45:10 -0500] [niggard in #debian] none
[2016-05-25 15:45:23 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yeah. geek != urban
[2016-05-25 15:46:49 -0500] [niggard in #debian] try&c is 1 letter longer and way mroe self-explanatory
[2016-05-25 15:46:55 -0500] [niggard in #debian] more*
[2016-05-25 15:47:18 -0500] [greycat in #debian] you're just making up new shit instead of using an acronym that has been in common use on this IRC network for *at least* 7 years
[2016-05-25 15:47:19 -0500] [markybob in #debian] niggard: great. you use it mate.
[2016-05-25 15:47:38 -0500] [foul_owl in #debian] Is there a way to tell how long xscreensaver has been running? ie, ensure that no one has logged into a system?
[2016-05-25 15:47:49 -0500] [greycat in #debian] foul_owl: ps will show you when the process started
[2016-05-25 15:48:26 -0500] [foul_owl in #debian] Hmm but that's the xscreensaver server
[2016-05-25 15:48:52 -0500] [foul_owl in #debian] I want to know how long the actual screensaver piece of it has been running
[2016-05-25 15:48:54 -0500] [greycat in #debian] The... what... OK, I give up.  It's another damned GUI question that nobody can ever understand unless they use that GUI.
[2016-05-25 15:49:06 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Good luck.
[2016-05-25 15:55:00 -0500] [trysten in #debian] lol @ niggard suggestion of a different acronym
[2016-05-25 15:55:51 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I'd rather not use any acronym for that at all
[2016-05-25 15:56:23 -0500] [markybob in #debian] my /ignore list just keeps growing
[2016-05-25 16:00:49 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] devster31: smartmon_tools can do some analysis, there may already be stuff in dmesg or syslog.
[2016-05-25 16:02:05 -0500] [niggard in #debian] can one add an alias that contains two words?
[2016-05-25 16:02:15 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I tried and it didn't work
[2016-05-25 16:02:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] A shell alias?
[2016-05-25 16:02:51 -0500] [niggard in #debian] yeah, any shell
[2016-05-25 16:02:57 -0500] [niggard in #debian] maybe there's a syntax issue, like I'm supposed to enclose the left part (alias name) into quotes just as I do for the right part
[2016-05-25 16:03:02 -0500] [greycat in #debian] A bash alias has to be a single word.
[2016-05-25 16:03:43 -0500] [greycat in #debian] The bash parser lexes the command line into words, and then sees if the first word is the name of an alias, etc.
[2016-05-25 16:04:11 -0500] [greycat in #debian] (There are a million esoteric rules and glitches.  It's like the most complicated godawful language ever created.)
[2016-05-25 16:04:41 -0500] [niggard in #debian] can an alias be like a variable - just get replaced into some arbitrary text (so that I could use it to parameters for a command)?
[2016-05-25 16:05:43 -0500] [greycat in #debian] No.  Aliases are only expanded for the first word in the command (the command name).
[2016-05-25 16:06:08 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If you want a variable expansion in the middle of the command, you need to put $ in front of it, and quote properly.
[2016-05-25 16:10:05 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I guess I can make use of a function instead
[2016-05-25 16:17:10 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] why'd you want to do any of that anyway
[2016-05-25 16:18:57 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I wanted to make an alias 'fuse sshserver' to mount it to the pre-defined dir, since I try to make things universal - I thought that once I'd maybe have access to more than 1 ssh server and thus I'd rather keep 2 words in the alias
[2016-05-25 16:19:15 -0500] [niggard in #debian] fuse sshserver, defuse sshserver. short and awesome.
[2016-05-25 16:20:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] he means why don't you just merge like normal folk?
[2016-05-25 16:20:37 -0500] [niggard in #debian] sorry? what do you mean by merge?
[2016-05-25 16:20:50 -0500] [niggard in #debian] oh, you mean merge 2 words into something like fusesshserver?
[2016-05-25 16:21:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yes
[2016-05-25 16:21:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] niggard: that's fine if "fuse" is a shell function.
[2016-05-25 16:21:56 -0500] [greycat in #debian] fuse() { sshfs "$1": /my/directory; }
[2016-05-25 16:22:12 -0500] [niggard in #debian] only for aesthetic reasons… functionally I think merging is an acceptable solution
[2016-05-25 16:23:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] defuse() { fusermount -u /my/directory; }
[2016-05-25 16:23:47 -0500] [niggard in #debian] greycat: but unlike in the variant suggested by markybob - I lose the autocomplete functionality this way, is there a way to not lose it?
[2016-05-25 16:23:55 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Oh fuck autocompletion.
[2016-05-25 16:24:15 -0500] [niggard in #debian] well, screw typos as well
[2016-05-25 16:24:18 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yeah. i tap out at that as well
[2016-05-25 16:24:21 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Gods.  I'm sure one could write a bash completion function for your ssh servers, but I won't be the one to do it.
[2016-05-25 16:24:54 -0500] [niggard in #debian] bash_autocompletion is something I haven't yet learned.
[2016-05-25 16:26:34 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] any difference between dpkg-query -l and dpkg -l
[2016-05-25 16:26:35 -0500] [niggard in #debian] I switched to zsh to give it a good try and basically converted .bashrc to .zshrc (using their script), but bash_autocompletion gives errors: https://paste.kde.org/pckjzqmtl
[2016-05-25 16:26:36 -0500] [snfgf in #debian] ?
[2016-05-25 16:27:10 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Occasionally someone in #bash will understand bash's programmable completion, but there's no guarantee.
[2016-05-25 16:27:18 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Most of us just don't touch it at all.
[2016-05-25 16:33:23 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] is there some setting for mdraid/lvm that throttles read/write requests?  i have an lvm volume in a raid1 and i'm extracting a tar file (which mostly contains tar files) and according to pv, it's peaking at about 30MB/s !?
[2016-05-25 16:33:48 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] there is no way these HDs can do 30MB/s max even with seeking to extract a tar
[2016-05-25 16:34:13 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Did you expect it to be lower, or higher?
[2016-05-25 16:35:28 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] significantly higher
[2016-05-25 16:35:43 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Solid state?
[2016-05-25 16:35:50 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] i mean fuck, 30MB/s is USB2 half duplex speed
[2016-05-25 16:36:01 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Bus speed and drive speed are usually not related.
[2016-05-25 16:36:20 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] no but i'd expect an internal SAN drive to be able to pull more than this
[2016-05-25 16:36:38 -0500] [greycat in #debian] What is an "internal SAN"?  Is it SATA?  SCSI?  IDE?
[2016-05-25 16:36:48 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] SATA3
[2016-05-25 16:36:52 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Is it a spinning magnetic disk, or solid state?
[2016-05-25 16:37:37 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] spinning magnetic, product specs claim average transfer speeds around 145MB/s.  i know copying data to the same drive causes seek overhead, but i didn't think it would be that awful.
[2016-05-25 16:38:04 -0500] [greycat in #debian] That sounds like a vastly inflated average transfer speed.

[2016-05-25 16:39:52 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] greycat: i suppose in perspective, i'm also writing 30MB/s
[2016-05-25 16:41:57 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] afernandez_: probably something broken in kanotix, you should ask in #kanotix instead. Debian 8 has monitoring-plugins 2.1.1 as a package
[2016-05-25 16:42:28 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] OK Thank you.
[2016-05-25 16:43:23 -0500] [matte0 in #debian] does anyone know the best way to remediate CVE-2015-5600 in Debian Jessie 8.4?
[2016-05-25 16:43:27 -0500] [HarveyPwca in #debian] Whether the SAN is 'internal' or 'external' would depend on your perspective. In other words, is the storage area internal to your network or external to it. Complicating matters is "The Cloud" because that can end up being your LAN… in which case your SAN is indeed on your LAN but that is actually part of a WAN.
[2016-05-25 16:44:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] matte0: did you see the note? https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5600
[2016-05-25 16:44:54 -0500] [HarveyPwca in #debian] BTW, all of these are hardware agnostic. The actual hardware where the data is stored can be IDE, SATA, SCSI, SSD.
[2016-05-25 16:45:30 -0500] [HarveyPwca in #debian] Or some combination of them.
[2016-05-25 16:45:49 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] how do i install sslutils in debian 8?
[2016-05-25 16:46:07 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] SerajewelKS: USB?
[2016-05-25 16:47:01 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] SerajewelKS: n'mind, stuck in the scrollback again.
[2016-05-25 16:52:31 -0500] [markybob in #debian] afernandez_: we already know you're not using debian.
[2016-05-25 16:53:21 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] So if I am not using Debian I can not ask a debian related question?
[2016-05-25 16:53:54 -0500] [Scourje in #debian] It makes me wonder
[2016-05-25 16:54:42 -0500] [markybob in #debian] afernandez_: you're asking for help for a derivative. we all know this. makes us not want/able to help no matter how much you change the story
[2016-05-25 16:56:40 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] afernandez_: yes, this channel is only for Debian not derivatives
[2016-05-25 16:59:22 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thanks I installed monitoring-plugins 2.1.1 and i move them to the correct dir .
[2016-05-25 17:04:58 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Debian guys, some oif the monitoring plugins just have a number in the script I do not know how to repoirt that
[2016-05-25 17:05:00 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] such as:

[2016-05-25 17:20:21 -0500] [mutante in #debian] trysten: do you have something like /etc/systemd/system/LVM-activation.service ?
[2016-05-25 17:20:39 -0500] [trysten in #debian] yes. i'm new to systemd sooo
[2016-05-25 17:21:00 -0500] [mutante in #debian] trysten: so in that file, there should be an [Install] section
[2016-05-25 17:21:17 -0500] [mutante in #debian] and there it probably says "WantedBy=multi-user.target"
[2016-05-25 17:21:25 -0500] [mutante in #debian] i think you could comment that line
[2016-05-25 17:25:14 -0500] [trysten in #debian] mutante: can i invoke systemctl to do that?
[2016-05-25 17:27:17 -0500] [mutante in #debian] trysten: systemctl disable  , yea

[2016-05-25 17:34:16 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] hi
[2016-05-25 17:34:30 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] I need flash player
[2016-05-25 17:34:41 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] debian version 8.4.0 x64
[2016-05-25 17:35:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Nuri: https://wiki.debian.org/FlashPlayer
[2016-05-25 17:36:10 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] my browser Iceweasel
[2016-05-25 17:36:18 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] ty markybob
[2016-05-25 17:37:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i know iceweasel is dropping flash support soonish. fyi.
[2016-05-25 17:38:17 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] markybob: is iceweasel droping NAPI too?
[2016-05-25 17:38:32 -0500] [markybob in #debian] somiaj: that's my understanding
[2016-05-25 17:38:39 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] (well guess we should say firefox, since iceweasel won't be the newer version)
[2016-05-25 17:38:59 -0500] [trysten in #debian] mutante: how about if i just want to make it non-critical?
[2016-05-25 17:39:01 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] markybob: ahh, haven't heard that. Are they gonig to adopt PAPI or just drop plugins all together and only use extensions?
[2016-05-25 17:39:17 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] Could not find package
[2016-05-25 17:39:30 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Nuri: the packages are in contrib, as they will install non-free software on your system
[2016-05-25 17:39:53 -0500] [markybob in #debian] somiaj: https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/10/08/npapi-plugins-in-firefox/
[2016-05-25 17:40:07 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Nuri: also note there is a PAPI wrapper for pepperflash with iceweasel if you want the newer flash matained by google in firefox
[2016-05-25 17:41:34 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] markybob: seems they will support flash in someway, though if they don't allow NAPI plugins it might hurt the linux comunity (kinda like chromium did until we figured out how to rip flash out of chrome)
[2016-05-25 17:42:13 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] markybob: thanks for the link
[2016-05-25 17:42:39 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] what should i do now
[2016-05-25 17:43:01 -0500] [xenial in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops ?
[2016-05-25 17:43:11 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Nuri: are you okay with installing non-free flash on your computer? Do you want the older flash from adobe or the google-chrome flash plugin (both will work just fine on most sites)
[2016-05-25 17:44:17 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] !contrib
[2016-05-25 17:44:17 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] [contrib] Debian packages that contain <DFSG>-compliant software, but have dependencies not in main (possibly packaged for Debian in non-free).  To get contrib packages, add lines like "deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/ [jessie|stretch|sid] main contrib" to your /etc/apt/sources.list, then «aptitude update».  Also ask me about <non-free>, <contrib list>.
[2016-05-25 17:44:58 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Nuri: I have to go, but to install non-free flash in debian follow the instructions the bot dpkg said to enable the contrib repo in your souces.list
[2016-05-25 17:45:23 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Nuri: once you do that you can install either 'flashplugin-nonfree' (for the older adobe flash) or 'browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash' *
[2016-05-25 17:45:33 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] the second one is for the newer google-chrome flash.
[2016-05-25 17:45:40 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Others can help if you run into any issues doing this.
[2016-05-25 17:46:26 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] ty
[2016-05-25 17:47:14 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] Which do you recommend somiaj
[2016-05-25 17:47:23 -0500] [Nuri in #debian] somiaj: Which do you recommend
[2016-05-25 17:48:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Nuri: you probably want the chrome one. keep in mind there's no sandboxing like in chrome
[2016-05-25 17:49:37 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] hola xenial 
[2016-05-25 17:50:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Nuri: you don't want netflix, do you?
[2016-05-25 17:51:20 -0500] [trysten in #debian] damnit! why is systemd so obscure to me? /rant
[2016-05-25 17:51:45 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: probably because you've failed to teach yourself :P
[2016-05-25 17:52:41 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] trysten: all change involves some discomfort :)   try to ignore all the bad things people say, and just go read some tutorial blogs - it's rare that I've not been able to find good explanations of behaviour I hvaen't immediately understood, and solutions to problems I've had.
[2016-05-25 17:53:29 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: honestly everything but binary logs makes sense to me. i like it.
[2016-05-25 17:53:42 -0500] [trysten in #debian] the behavior is pretty ok, i just can't get around it and it's keeping me from booting. arrrrgh! you're right though. I'm not really opposed to systemd
[2016-05-25 17:53:51 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i tried to be.. but even linux says meh
[2016-05-25 17:53:54 -0500] [trysten in #debian] linus*
[2016-05-25 17:54:13 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] trysten: any particular thing you're having troubles with now?
[2016-05-25 17:54:18 -0500] [markybob in #debian] trysten: no. linus said the same thing i did. only against binary logs.
[2016-05-25 17:54:49 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] usually the thing that bites me is drop-in .service replacements for init.d scripts ... that don't drop-in quite as transparently as I'd hoped.
[2016-05-25 17:55:35 -0500] [trysten in #debian] markybob: "those are details, not big issues"
[2016-05-25 17:57:21 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jeddi: right now i'm trying to work around the automatically generated dependency on a non-important lvm2 volume group. it's missing PVs so it can't activate which drops me to (glitchy) recovery console
[2016-05-25 17:58:43 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] is there a mode of tar that will preserve user/group information by name, not id?
[2016-05-25 17:59:03 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] or is there another recommended way to transfer files that will account for user/group ids being different?
[2016-05-25 17:59:17 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] i think rsync can handle that
[2016-05-25 17:59:24 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] trysten: aha.  yeah.  that may be fun.   my first upgrade to systemd ages a while back broke on a combination of lvm2 and / being a cryptsetup partition.
[2016-05-25 17:59:44 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] trysten: are there filesystems in this VG that are in /etc/fstab? take a look at "man systemd.mount" for the nofail option
[2016-05-25 18:02:17 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] SerajewelKS: i don't think (but may be wrong) that you can do this - for fairly sensible reasons most utils will use uid, not username.
[2016-05-25 18:03:01 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] rsync --usermap closest i can think
[2016-05-25 18:04:03 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] sweettea: nice find!
[2016-05-25 18:05:06 -0500] [ZenWalker in #debian-es-offtopic] Xen y Hal
[2016-05-25 18:05:36 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] hail!
[2016-05-25 18:05:53 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] jeddi: it would be sensible, if wheezy and jessie system group ids were the same, but they are not
[2016-05-25 18:06:04 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] i actually dont think that will do what he wants tho
[2016-05-25 18:06:20 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] jeddi: so in migrating some /etc stuff i need to be able to handle users and groups as names not as ids
[2016-05-25 18:06:37 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] uid/gid are consistency is not specific to distro
[2016-05-25 18:06:52 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] sweettea: that's not english
[2016-05-25 18:06:53 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] hell any distro if you install stuff in differing order will generate different uid/gid
[2016-05-25 18:07:07 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] sweettea: i'm not saying the ids SHOULD be the same
[2016-05-25 18:07:27 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] sweettea: i'm saying that in transferring some configuration over, i need ownership information to be retained by name, not by id
[2016-05-25 18:07:55 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] solve the problem with some basic bash?
[2016-05-25 18:07:56 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] otherwise, stuff that was owned by www-data is owned by mlocate on the new system
[2016-05-25 18:07:59 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] its trivial
[2016-05-25 18:08:07 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] SerajewelKS: ah.  okay.  this hasn't bitten me before, but i've not tried copying swathes of /etc around - i'm either upgrading, or it's being (re)installed from a config manager.
[2016-05-25 18:08:27 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] sweettea: it's not trivial, but thanks for playing
[2016-05-25 18:08:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i'd be much more worried about permissions than ownership
[2016-05-25 18:09:08 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] markybob: you can't worry about one without worrying about the other
[2016-05-25 18:09:15 -0500] [mutante in #debian] SerajewelKS:  find / -uid <old UID> -exec chown <new UID>
[2016-05-25 18:09:24 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] markybob: if permissions are right and ownership is not, someone else has access
[2016-05-25 18:09:25 -0500] [markybob in #debian] you kinda can. one is much easier to fix
[2016-05-25 18:09:31 -0500] [mutante in #debian] had to do that multiple times when users migrate
[2016-05-25 18:09:49 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] mutante: and what do you do in the case where group IDs are inverted?
[2016-05-25 18:10:36 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] we're basically talking about building a ridiculous find expression for something that seems reasonable to find in some system utility somewhere
[2016-05-25 18:10:55 -0500] [markybob in #debian] the point is you're not going to save both when the've changed.
[2016-05-25 18:10:57 -0500] [mutante in #debian] SerajewelKS: eh.. you look for all files owned by the old user or gid and switch it to the new ones  (there is -gid  as a find option )
[2016-05-25 18:11:05 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] its pretty basic
[2016-05-25 18:11:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] exactly. it is basic.
[2016-05-25 18:11:25 -0500] [mutante in #debian] it's not even an expression, just "uid" and "gid"
[2016-05-25 18:11:36 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] mutante: when group A/B had ids 5/6 on the old system and have ids 6/5 on the new system, find isn't going to work without getting ridiculous
[2016-05-25 18:12:59 -0500] [markybob in #debian] we've already gotten ridiculous
[2016-05-25 18:13:16 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] sweettea: FWIW your suggestion regarding rsync was in fact correct -- it uses names and not ids for ownership, unless you specify --numeric-ids
[2016-05-25 18:13:21 -0500] [mutante in #debian] SerajewelKS: ok, i guess i was lucky with that, but not sure how another utility would fix that. you can temp give it a random high UID, then change it back
[2016-05-25 18:13:32 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] so the correct answer to this question is not "find ... -exec chown" but "use rsync"
[2016-05-25 18:13:39 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] ...
[2016-05-25 18:15:08 -0500] [SerajewelKS in #debian] which makes me happy, because mapping this stuff by hand is a recipe for screwing it up badly
[2016-05-25 18:15:21 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] rsync will cause you different problems
[2016-05-25 18:15:44 -0500] [sweettea in #debian] the solution is to properly architect this and perhaps use automation for your binaries/confs
[2016-05-25 18:22:00 -0500] [trysten in #debian] where is systemd configured to take me to Emergency Mode?
[2016-05-25 18:23:40 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] https://wiki.debian.org/systemd#Debugging see especially solutions 3 and 4
[2016-05-25 18:23:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] trysten: did you try setting nofail in fstab?
[2016-05-25 18:24:05 -0500] [trysten in #debian] thanks. to answer your earlier question, they are not listed in fstab
[2016-05-25 18:24:41 -0500] [trysten in #debian] unless fstab was automatically appended when i activated the lv
[2016-05-25 18:25:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] trysten: no. the problem is that boot fails because of a missing PV?
[2016-05-25 18:30:08 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, no
[2016-05-25 18:30:09 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jmcnaught: well, it was. it's booting now. i'm trying to make it fail again, but systemctl enable lvm2-activation[-early].service did not enable the problem
[2016-05-25 18:30:16 -0500] [trysten in #debian] trysten, no
[2016-05-25 18:30:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, fstab is never touched by anything except when installing debian
[2016-05-25 18:30:30 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jml2: cool. i would have guessed that
[2016-05-25 18:30:53 -0500] [trysten in #debian] that's what i would have guessed, rather
[2016-05-25 18:31:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, man mtab
[2016-05-25 18:31:17 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] (nm that, it's not there)
[2016-05-25 18:32:26 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jml2: i don't have mtab manpage..?
[2016-05-25 18:32:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] no need
[2016-05-25 18:32:55 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] (scratches head)
[2016-05-25 18:33:09 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jml2: yeah, just curious as to where it is/comes from
[2016-05-25 18:33:41 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] no need to worry about that-- that was just for informational purposes :)
[2016-05-25 18:33:52 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jmcnaught: you know, you and I have been on the channel for years. I used to go by acid or acidslep. good to see you still around
[2016-05-25 18:34:42 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jml2: thank you! i didn't know about it. any ideas on how to rebreak my system? systemctl enable lvm2-activation.service didn't actually bring it back, like it's not a dependency any more
[2016-05-25 18:35:08 -0500] [trysten in #debian] jmcnaught: oh. it is in fstab. ha.
[2016-05-25 18:35:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, btw for "target" rescue mode, it should be possible to use that for the kernel's boot-line..  it'd be something like target= ...
[2016-05-25 18:38:05 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Change_default_target_to_boot_into
[2016-05-25 18:38:13 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] trysten, would be in debian wiki too
[2016-05-25 18:38:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] it's rather something else with =, for the target ("runlevel")
[2016-05-25 18:38:44 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] trysten: on my system lvm2-activation.service is Type=oneshot (so it doesn't stay active after it runs) and is WantedBy=local-fs.target. Its only entries in the journal are reporting that my VGs are now active
[2016-05-25 18:40:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] trysten: so "systemctl status lvm2-activation" will say "inactive (dead)" because Type=Oneshot means it doesn't need to stay active
[2016-05-25 18:40:24 -0500] [trysten in #debian] is having multiple epiphanygasms
[2016-05-25 18:40:36 -0500] [trysten in #debian] thank you so much, jmcnaught, jml2. love you guys
[2016-05-25 18:42:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] i keep forgetting systemd syntax multiple times tehehe
[2016-05-25 18:42:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] my bad
[2016-05-25 18:42:36 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] i've been starting to forget pre-systemd syntax, like update-rc.d etc
[2016-05-25 18:46:20 -0500] [shadows in #debian] jmcnaught: good riddance, thought I am sad that Ubuntu's upstart claimed easy things like "start" "stop" "restart"
[2016-05-25 18:46:50 -0500] [shadows in #debian] "journalctl" and "systemctl" are cumbersome to type as a rule
[2016-05-25 18:47:44 -0500] [aypea[2] in #debian] yerp
[2016-05-25 18:47:58 -0500] [countbackula in #debian] journalctl is also very difficult for one with dyslexia
[2016-05-25 18:48:02 -0500] [markybob in #debian] if you think so make an alias. jcl  and scl or whatever.
[2016-05-25 18:48:12 -0500] [shadows in #debian] markybob: on every system I interact with?
[2016-05-25 18:48:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] if you cant be bothered to type
[2016-05-25 18:48:50 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i personally just type because i know how
[2016-05-25 18:48:50 -0500] [mutante in #debian] how about using Ctrl +R after you typed it once
[2016-05-25 18:49:20 -0500] [shadows in #debian] my discontent is not for having to alias and save keystrokes
[2016-05-25 18:49:32 -0500] [shadows in #debian] it is for the rather cumbersome name to begin with
[2016-05-25 18:57:49 -0500] [bolts_ in #debian] Please help me rescue my boot: I accidentally commented out my encrypted root partition in /etc/crypttab, and my boot is falling back to initramfs
[2016-05-25 18:58:03 -0500] [bolts_ in #debian] cryptsetup is absent from initramfs for some reason
[2016-05-25 19:02:27 -0500] [user__ in #debian] does debian use fdisk?
[2016-05-25 19:03:02 -0500] [Alam_Squeeze in #debian] user__: you mean DOS fdisk or GNU fdisk?
[2016-05-25 19:03:11 -0500] [user__ in #debian] gnu
[2016-05-25 19:03:27 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] it does
[2016-05-25 19:03:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bolts_: you'll probably need to boot from a live disk, use cryptsetup to unlock the partition, chroot into it, fix /etc/crypttab, and run update-initramfs -u
[2016-05-25 19:03:44 -0500] [bolts_ in #debian] how can I mount and boot from a LUKS encrypted partition from within the initramfs prompt?
[2016-05-25 19:03:47 -0500] [user__ in #debian] when i type fdisk -l it is not showing the disked installed on the system
[2016-05-25 19:04:07 -0500] [bolts_ in #debian] jmcnaught: okay, I was worried that was the case
[2016-05-25 19:04:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bolts_: is the cryptsetup command available at the initramfs prompt?
[2016-05-25 19:04:20 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] user__: perhaps your disk controller needs a driver/module that's not loaded, check with dmesg to see if they're even recognized at all
[2016-05-25 19:04:30 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] user__: fdisk -l does show all disks under normal cirtcumstances
[2016-05-25 19:04:53 -0500] [bolts_ in #debian] jmcnaught: it is not

[2016-05-25 19:06:43 -0500] [jeddi in #debian] yeah - previously i've had to pull the initram image across to anotehr machine, pull it open (cpio?) and put the libraries / binaries I needed in there, then load it back on the broken box.   a live-cd option didn't work for me - i think  I couldn't work out how to remake the initram image once i'd booted from cd onto the original /
[2016-05-25 19:06:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] user__: fdisk lives at /sbin/fdisk which is not in the $PATH for a regular user (because it's normally root that would run it).
[2016-05-25 19:07:28 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] user__: what does "lsblk" say?
[2016-05-25 19:07:37 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] user__: read your own screenshot; you tried to install fidsk, not fdisk, but, it's in the package util-linux
[2016-05-25 19:07:40 -0500] [niggard in #debian] hey debs, what's going on? I mounted an ssh connection (using sshfs) to a local dir and now I can't unmount it, I get this error: 'fusermount:2: maximum nested function level reached' what's that?
[2016-05-25 19:07:58 -0500] [user__ in #debian] That command lists all the current hard drives installed
[2016-05-25 19:08:11 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] user__: apt-get install util-linux
[2016-05-25 19:09:13 -0500] [niggard in #debian] [I use 'fusermount -u ~/mount/ssh' when I get the above error]
[2016-05-25 19:09:24 -0500] [user__ in #debian] okay
[2016-05-25 19:12:46 -0500] [niggard in #debian] weird error, I reopened a terminal window and the same command now doesn't yield any errors
[2016-05-25 19:13:41 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] i have a question: under the more modern conf directory arrangement where you have .../conf.d/....   how do you disable one of the conf scripts?  if you just rename one from say custom.conf.DIS it will still get sourced by the daemon.
[2016-05-25 19:14:25 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] they way the daemon should behave is that it should only source files named .*.conf$
[2016-05-25 19:14:53 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] ^.*\.conf$
[2016-05-25 19:14:57 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] depends on what software you're asking for; also, you could rename them to .<name>
[2016-05-25 19:15:04 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] most include conf.d/*
[2016-05-25 19:15:11 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: delete it or move it to a different directory. or depending on what software you're talking about, look for an Include statement of sorts to see what it pulls in
[2016-05-25 19:15:20 -0500] [Eduard_Munteanu in #debian] chmod u-r ?
[2016-05-25 19:15:32 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] apache
[2016-05-25 19:15:35 -0500] [mutante in #debian] or you just link files in there and then you can just remove the link and add it back
[2016-05-25 19:15:59 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] plus, most software has that include line jmcnaught talks about and you can probably "fix" it so it only does conf.d/*.conf; though .conf is already implied because of the directory name, so that's why it's usually conf.d/* ...
[2016-05-25 19:16:09 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] so apache will also source anything in /conf.d/DISABLED/..  ?
[2016-05-25 19:16:13 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] file extensions are windows thing anyway tbh
[2016-05-25 19:16:38 -0500] [mutante in #debian] alphazulu: actually it uses "conf-available" and "conf-enabled" and symlinks
[2016-05-25 19:16:45 -0500] [mutante in #debian] from some version on
[2016-05-25 19:16:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: on Wheezy? Apache on Jessie has conf-available and conf-enabled (like with sites and modules), and the include statement is explicit about only *.conf
[2016-05-25 19:17:01 -0500] [mutante in #debian] so you handle it like the sites too
[2016-05-25 19:17:08 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] oh i see!  thanks.  for some reason my ...conf.disabled got symlinked.  i probably forgot to remove it
[2016-05-25 19:18:45 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] jmcnaught: yes on a wheezy box
[2016-05-25 19:19:43 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] thanks
[2016-05-25 19:19:45 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: where did the conf file come from? it should be a conffile and safe to delete (or move somewhere else if you want to use it later)
[2016-05-25 19:20:48 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] jmcnaught: yes it was just a symlink to the actual file in ../conf-available/...
[2016-05-25 19:24:42 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: are you sure it's Wheezy then? Debian's apache2 2.2.22 on wheezy only had /etc/apache2/conf.d/ (it's Jessie that adds conf-available and conf-enable and the a2enconf/a2disconf commands)
[2016-05-25 19:26:54 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] yeah... we make all of those on our wheezy boxes :P
[2016-05-25 19:27:37 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] jmcnaught: Server version: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian);  cat /etc/debian_version  7.10
[2016-05-25 19:27:56 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] Good day
[2016-05-25 19:28:05 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] BenderRodriguez, good day
[2016-05-25 19:28:36 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: oh it's you
[2016-05-25 19:28:44 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] jmcnaught: ah, it came from this package: owncloud-config-apache
[2016-05-25 19:28:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] BenderRodriguez, what did i do?
[2016-05-25 19:29:07 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: well
[2016-05-25 19:29:13 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] dpkg -S /etc/apache2/conf-available
[2016-05-25 19:29:13 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Dingos ate my /etc/apache2/conf-available!
[2016-05-25 19:29:18 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: last time I recall, you went on a rant about Windows
[2016-05-25 19:29:28 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] which I didn't take too kindly
[2016-05-25 19:29:35 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: ahh.. that package is probably from a foreign/upstream repo then
[2016-05-25 19:29:47 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] BenderRodriguez, but you're saying "dear Linux" on #linux
[2016-05-25 19:29:51 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] yes the owncloud repo.
[2016-05-25 19:29:53 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] BenderRodriguez, you trolling linux channels again?
[2016-05-25 19:30:15 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmm
[2016-05-25 19:30:17 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: no that was legit question
[2016-05-25 19:30:18 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] alphazulu: no small wonder that it has some integration issues :)
[2016-05-25 19:30:20 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: no trolling
[2016-05-25 19:30:27 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] i think he's not using debian. :P)
[2016-05-25 19:30:33 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] digresses from trolls.
[2016-05-25 19:30:48 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] I'm using Ubuntu 16.04
[2016-05-25 19:30:55 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] But it's a kvm related question
[2016-05-25 19:31:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] BenderRodriguez, #ubuntu then
[2016-05-25 19:31:07 -0500] [mutante in #debian] (counts)
[2016-05-25 19:31:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] BenderRodriguez: you should ask in #ubuntu
[2016-05-25 19:31:09 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] ignores BenderRodriguez 
[2016-05-25 19:31:28 -0500] [alphazulu in #debian] jmcnaught: yes it was a big decision on my new jessie box whether to use their repo or not.  in the end i did because its more recent
[2016-05-25 19:31:37 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] jml2: why?
[2016-05-25 19:31:43 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] for software trade, where do i write sacrificial offering for kernel for my processors goodness that is debian and only only mine.  i want to offer redhat enterprise linux desktop only 7.2 in exchange for hand rolled fine mint kernel no holes and 4 time rehearsed
[2016-05-25 19:31:48 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] Ubuntu and Debian share the same codebase :P
[2016-05-25 19:32:00 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] dpkg: tell BenderRodriguez about based on debian
[2016-05-25 19:32:02 -0500] [mutante in #debian] BenderRodriguez: that won't work and is repeated like 10 times per day
[2016-05-25 19:32:21 -0500] [BenderRodriguez in #debian] In fact, prior to this, I've snuck in a few Ubuntu questions here in the past and the solutions worked
[2016-05-25 19:32:27 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] can't believe he's not banned yet. He's a problem.

[2016-05-25 19:38:01 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] smart tbh, Microsoft knows it's losing big bucks in the server OS world, so they're porting SQL Server and all other moneycows to Linux, and in return, making it easier for developers that want to use Linux, to use Windows.
[2016-05-25 19:38:11 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] FinalX: yeah the best of both worlds </sarcasm>
[2016-05-25 19:38:28 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'll analyze that coffees contents for 43 years before drink it
[2016-05-25 19:38:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thanks in advance in case your not there :D
[2016-05-25 19:39:08 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] I'm not one to partake in OS-flaming/software-wars. Everything has its upsides, downsides, likings and dislikings. I use whatever is most useful for the thing at hand :)
[2016-05-25 19:39:18 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] 43 years to analyze a coffee?
[2016-05-25 19:39:39 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] did not put his finger into the coffee while no one was looking. honest!
[2016-05-25 19:40:08 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] it my winning number.
[2016-05-25 19:40:14 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] hello all,  does anybody know if steam works properly on debian?
[2016-05-25 19:40:29 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I tried to follow some instructions to install it,  but it screwed up my system lol
[2016-05-25 19:40:30 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] licks a stirring spoon and puts it back with the others.
[2016-05-25 19:40:33 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] anyone have a good guide?
[2016-05-25 19:40:39 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i don't mean to overanalyze but when verse become 3 times rehearsed i knew it first.  i'm the script master.
[2016-05-25 19:40:57 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, well steamos is based on debian
[2016-05-25 19:41:11 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] can i speak to dexter
[2016-05-25 19:41:14 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, ya but they only support ubuntu
[2016-05-25 19:41:17 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i need tip
[2016-05-25 19:41:31 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] steam does i mean.  any good guide how to install it properly on debian?
[2016-05-25 19:41:42 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I don't believe there is a package for it in the repos
[2016-05-25 19:41:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Jaro: did you follow the instructions at https://wiki.debian.org/Steam ? You should use the steam package in Debian non-free, don't add the steampowered.com repo
[2016-05-25 19:41:56 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, steam works best with the nvidia driver
[2016-05-25 19:42:24 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i want baby back.  its not you.  she's illegal.   she believes in a beauty, but so help me God.  the parts don't fit
[2016-05-25 19:42:29 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, you have to install the proprietary driver for nvidia -- for intel gfx it's well the stock -kernel, for ati, it's whatever proprietary fglrx it uses
[2016-05-25 19:42:54 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, yes what happened was when I got to this part  aptitude install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386  it started to remove my whole system
[2016-05-25 19:43:10 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] then i had no desktop anymore when i rebooted
[2016-05-25 19:43:13 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, the latest nvidia proprietary i had to use apt-get -t jessie-backports, .340 didnt' work but .352 does
[2016-05-25 19:43:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, (Fwiw nvidia is packaged in backports)
[2016-05-25 19:43:36 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Jaro: sounds like problems caused by using the third-party steampowered repo
[2016-05-25 19:43:39 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] its that last step that didn't work for me, yes that is explained int hose directions
[2016-05-25 19:43:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, if you get a black screen, you might have to disable kms, and blacklist nouveau
[2016-05-25 19:43:58 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] is hould of read what I was hitting y for,  but ya,  it remoevd everything
[2016-05-25 19:44:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, (if you google those two things, you'll find many guides on how to do it)
[2016-05-25 19:44:07 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I didn't get a black screen it booted to a command prompt
[2016-05-25 19:44:12 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] it removed the desktop
[2016-05-25 19:44:19 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] aptitude install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386   <<<< this command removed everything when i hit y
[2016-05-25 19:44:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/video/medium-shot-baboon-pounding-on-laptop-keyboard-stock-video-footage/712-54
[2016-05-25 19:44:30 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i ate lunch at the food establishment that made the most sense.  its something like the most grueling torment only to look at your pancake and it smiles at you and it hurt so good.  hurt so good ?  thats bad ?  no.  thats good.  ROCK !   prayers work
[2016-05-25 19:44:33 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] has been looking for a new flat.
[2016-05-25 19:44:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, try again.. can't parser :)
[2016-05-25 19:44:56 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, what do you mean?
[2016-05-25 19:45:03 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] 500€ for a shitty 32m² apartment -.-
[2016-05-25 19:45:05 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, watch the video tutorial
[2016-05-25 19:46:46 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, so what did I do wrong with this command?  aptitude install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386
[2016-05-25 19:47:12 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] after i hit y,  it removed my desktop and everything in it lol
[2016-05-25 19:47:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, .340 makes you think you had to do that
[2016-05-25 19:47:23 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, use -t jessie-backports with .352
[2016-05-25 19:47:23 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] no you have to do that beacuse steam requires it
[2016-05-25 19:47:30 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, i gave you a solution
[2016-05-25 19:47:32 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] or else steam won't bit and woill compalin it needs tot he 32 bit lib
[2016-05-25 19:47:42 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, is there anyone else that knows what they are talking about that can answer me? lol
[2016-05-25 19:47:45 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Jaro, or you cna try .340 again but use -t jessie-backports
[2016-05-25 19:47:52 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] it has nothing to do with the drivers
[2016-05-25 19:48:01 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] steam is a 32 bit program and i'm using a 64 bit install
[2016-05-25 19:48:06 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] so that lib is needed to launch steam
[2016-05-25 19:48:11 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] can you go away now?
[2016-05-25 19:48:20 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jesus christ i fucking hate linux communities
[2016-05-25 19:48:31 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] you don't understand.  i was in so much pain, and the pancake smiled.
[2016-05-25 19:48:48 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] here I use steam.
[2016-05-25 19:48:48 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] crap.  i ate the pancake at random
[2016-05-25 19:48:50 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] :)
[2016-05-25 19:48:53 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] good bye Jaro :)
[2016-05-25 19:48:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] it wasn't the cook
[2016-05-25 19:49:03 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Jaro: did you add a repository to your sources.list for steam, or download a .deb that you installed with "dpkg -i"?
[2016-05-25 19:49:04 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] it gives this warning "Installing the 32-bit OpenGL libraries may uninstall the 64-bit drivers you may have previously installed. Installing the AMD graphics or NVIDIA graphics drivers for your system is recommended. The appropriate OpenGL library will be installed along with those drivers."
[2016-05-25 19:49:06 -0500] [mutante in #debian] telling the guy who gives you the answer he doesnt know what he is talking about ... kinda rude
[2016-05-25 19:49:17 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but the problem is it doesn't tell you its also going to remove your whole desktop and leave with nothing but a text prompot haha
[2016-05-25 19:49:27 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] there will be no x to start
[2016-05-25 19:50:00 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] installing the nvidia drivers does not install that 32 bit lib
[2016-05-25 19:50:09 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] you have to install that file,  but how can i install it,  without removing anything.
[2016-05-25 19:50:23 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] isn't it like a simple flag.   am in the twilight zone right now? hahah
[2016-05-25 19:50:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Jaro: i'd help you if you answered any of my questions
[2016-05-25 19:50:34 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I guess i have to stick with ubuntu like a noob then.  fuck debian.
[2016-05-25 19:50:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] !ops Jaro trolling
[2016-05-25 19:50:42 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Hydroxide, dondelelcaro, LoRez, RichiH, mentor, abrotman, Maulkin, stew, peterS, Myon, Ganneff, weasel, zobel, themill, babilen, SynrG, jm_, somiaj, jelly: jml2 complains about: Jaro trolling
[2016-05-25 19:50:44 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] enough
[2016-05-25 19:50:47 -0500] [mutante in #debian] gamers...
[2016-05-25 19:50:52 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, you are the one trolling me man
[2016-05-25 19:50:56 -0500] [AbsurdTech in #debian] What's this?
[2016-05-25 19:51:13 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] someone needs to fix those debian instructions
[2016-05-25 19:51:23 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] all it is guiding people to do,  is break their whole system.
[2016-05-25 19:51:43 -0500] [AbsurdTech in #debian] Jaro: Just stick to what Valve/GOG/Humble Bundle reccomends
[2016-05-25 19:51:51 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] AbsurdTech, apparenlty.
[2016-05-25 19:52:13 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but ubuntu is such spyware :(
[2016-05-25 19:52:39 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i think big brother got to the developer of peerguardian
[2016-05-25 19:52:50 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] it wasn't random ?
[2016-05-25 19:52:55 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] :D
[2016-05-25 19:52:58 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] its the craziest thing.  on ubuntu 16.04. it  only pretends to add your blocklists,  but doesn't really block anything.  even though everything appears to be working
[2016-05-25 19:52:59 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] samurai slice
[2016-05-25 19:53:00 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: It sounds like you are mixing things, but I have not followed the whole issue. You may be frustrated but please refrain from harsh language and talking about ubuntu.
[2016-05-25 19:53:02 -0500] [mutante in #debian] *plenk*
[2016-05-25 19:53:03 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] on debian it works as it should lol
[2016-05-25 19:53:07 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] just one example...
[2016-05-25 19:53:30 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Jaro: if you want help with the issue you're having with that pakage trying to remove stuff, you can make a paste of the output on http://paste.debian.net/ Please also "/msg dpkg bat" for more troubleshooting information that will help us help you
[2016-05-25 19:53:42 -0500] [CuteMeOwnThroat in #debian] mutante, maybe rude, but possibly accurate... ignoring the *other* guy who has a pretty good guess at the situation and the answer to that is stupid
[2016-05-25 19:53:46 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, when using this command aptitude install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386     it removed my whole desktop
[2016-05-25 19:54:02 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i thought maybe i was supposed to put an extra flag after it thats not in instructions.
[2016-05-25 19:54:14 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] it removed everything except core linux files haha  libreoffice everything...
[2016-05-25 19:54:16 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: what version of debain are you running, cayou you paste teh output of apt-cache policy libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386 at paste.debian.net
[2016-05-25 19:54:26 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i felt like an idiot afterwards cause i just immediately hit y
[2016-05-25 19:54:47 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, i'm on ubuntu right now wanting to go back to debian
[2016-05-25 19:54:52 -0500] [AbsurdTech in #debian] CuteMeOwnThroat: Who, me?
[2016-05-25 19:55:04 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: sounds like you have an issue with your sources.list (or packages you have isntaleled out side of debian), #debian will help you out.
[2016-05-25 19:55:11 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, i followed the instructions here  https://wiki.debian.org/Steam
[2016-05-25 19:55:33 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, I installed nothing but steam immediately after a fresh install and update.
[2016-05-25 19:55:55 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] CuteMeOwnThroat: heya. feeling any better?
[2016-05-25 19:56:06 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, I got to this step Install 32-bit OpenGL libraries:
[2016-05-25 19:56:10 -0500] [CuteMeOwnThroat in #debian] AbsurdTech, no :) earlier, jmcnaught probably had it in one go... oh well, have fun
[2016-05-25 19:56:14 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] step 4.  it all went wrong then
[2016-05-25 19:56:26 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] and apparenlty it is indeed needed.  because steam will complain it doesn't have those libraries when trying to launch it.
[2016-05-25 19:57:06 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, so you mean to tell me that simply doing that command shouldn't remove my whole system?  are you sure?
[2016-05-25 19:57:15 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] those instructions do give a warning
[2016-05-25 19:57:18 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: Well #debian can help you get things working. I think the issue is debian will not isntall the nvidia non-free drivers by default as the defatuls in debain are for a free os.
[2016-05-25 19:57:38 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: Would you like to try to fix your current install or would you prefer a reinstall and then get help once you get to this point.
[2016-05-25 19:57:50 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, did you look at the debian wiki directions?
[2016-05-25 19:58:27 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, oh wait,  so you think the issue is that I installed the nvidia prop drivers before doing all this is the issue?
[2016-05-25 19:58:35 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: yes I did, note these are written by users of debian and sometimes things change. Seems the writer of those assums you already have the non-free drivers installed, but this will not be the case ona fresh install of debian.
[2016-05-25 19:58:45 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] ya I did.
[2016-05-25 19:58:52 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: you installed the nvidia drivers from nvidia.com using their .run file?
[2016-05-25 19:58:53 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] its the first thign I did,  then I followed those instructions
[2016-05-25 19:59:11 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] maybe that is the problem,  although the warning there says that 32 bit library will be installed with the nvidia non free drivers,  but that is not true.
[2016-05-25 19:59:12 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: or a better question, how did you install the nvidia drivers?
[2016-05-25 19:59:23 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] it doesn't get installed with nvidia non free drivers
[2016-05-25 19:59:45 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] the same exact way jml2 said earlier
[2016-05-25 19:59:49 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] with the backports,  same command
[2016-05-25 19:59:51 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] hi, how can i open .docx file in debian, it wont work with any default prpgram
[2016-05-25 19:59:55 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I think its another wiki lol
[2016-05-25 20:00:14 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: so you installed the nvidia drivers from debian's jessie-backport repo?
[2016-05-25 20:00:37 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] linad3rr: libreoffice will open .docx files (there are also other apps that will)
[2016-05-25 20:00:51 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, i did it this way.  followed the example there for 352.79 drivers  https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers
[2016-05-25 20:01:15 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I actually found that page before using the steam instructions.
[2016-05-25 20:01:23 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: okay that was the issue, the instructions for installing the 32bit drivers assume you are using the drivers from jessie, not jessie-backports
[2016-05-25 20:01:25 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i installed drivers and rebooted.  the proceeded to use steam instructions
[2016-05-25 20:01:39 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: you would have to have added a -t jessie-backports to the apt-get install command that wanted to install the 32bit drivers
[2016-05-25 20:01:41 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] somiaj : The file 'screenshot.docx' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file.
[2016-05-25 20:01:41 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] The corruption could be the result of document manipulation or of structural document damage due to data transmission.
[2016-05-25 20:01:42 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] We recommend that you do not trust the content of the repaired document.
[2016-05-25 20:01:42 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] Execution of macros is disabled for this document.
[2016-05-25 20:01:42 -0500] [linad3rr in #debian] Should LibreOffice repair the file?
[2016-05-25 20:01:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] somiaj, told him that twice
[2016-05-25 20:01:57 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] somiaj, good luck
[2016-05-25 20:02:16 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, so first i would have to install a kernel i guess from the backports?
[2016-05-25 20:02:19 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] jml2: ahh, I didn't follow the whole conversation, I was just trying to difuse the situation back to support.
[2016-05-25 20:02:26 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, can you ignore him please
[2016-05-25 20:02:40 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] he told me i needed the 32 bit lib for the drivers,  I need it for steam obviously
[2016-05-25 20:02:59 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, so back to my question.  so then before doing what you suggested i would need to install a backport kernel first yes?
[2016-05-25 20:03:05 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: I'm unsure if the nvidia drivers in backports requires a backported kernel or not. It may be they will compile against the kernel in jessie
[2016-05-25 20:03:30 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, well according the wiki,  it says  "Or if you are already using a Linux kernel from jessie-backports:
[2016-05-25 20:03:31 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] "
[2016-05-25 20:03:47 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] then suggests the same commmand you suggested.  so does that mean i need a kernel from there first?
[2016-05-25 20:03:51 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: again please keep on support, lets not owrry about other users.
[2016-05-25 20:04:03 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] otherwise it says "Install Linux headers for the kernel you are using. If you are using the 3.16 Linux kernel in Debian Jessie:"
[2016-05-25 20:04:05 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: what nvidia card do you have?
[2016-05-25 20:04:07 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] and suggest commmand without the T
[2016-05-25 20:05:14 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] sigh...
[2016-05-25 20:05:18 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: correct, when using jessie-backports you will have to keep track what you are running from jessie-backports and adjust instructions accordinly
[2016-05-25 20:05:29 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: but back to the question, what nvidia card do you have?
[2016-05-25 20:06:02 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, its hard to trust you understand what i'm trying to do,  when you don't even look at the debian wiki instructions i'm using.
[2016-05-25 20:07:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian] Jaro: this would go faster if you just answered the questions. you are rather noisy, makes it hard to follow.
[2016-05-25 20:07:26 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, scroll down to debian 8 "jessie" instructions https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers
[2016-05-25 20:07:46 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] thats what i did.    then go to   https://wiki.debian.org/Steam   and thats what I did next
[2016-05-25 20:07:51 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] the last step removed the desktop
[2016-05-25 20:08:08 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: yes, what I want to know is what nvidia card you actually have. This will affect my advise on if you should install the drivers from jessie-backports or not.
[2016-05-25 20:08:12 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, so apparenlty I already did what you suggested
[2016-05-25 20:08:26 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i want at least that deriver man  352
[2016-05-25 20:08:36 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] 362 would be even better
[2016-05-25 20:08:41 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but i'll take 352
[2016-05-25 20:09:25 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian] What card are you using?
[2016-05-25 20:09:40 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i'm not gonna say what card i'm using.
[2016-05-25 20:09:54 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] because it doesn't matter.  and if that means you can't help me. you are no help anyways...
[2016-05-25 20:09:57 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: In that case yes, the only thing that caused the error was you tried to mix the 64bit version from jessie-backports with the 32bit version from jessie which caused a conflict that removed some packages (and as a chain hit your desktop due to a meta package)
[2016-05-25 20:10:15 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, just like jml2,  you don't understand.  the 32 bit library is required for steam
[2016-05-25 20:10:29 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] if you read the directions i'm using.  you will see how it explains that on the very page,  with a fucking warning i don't undersatnd
[2016-05-25 20:10:37 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but if you donm'[ even want to read it.  how you can possibly help me?
[2016-05-25 20:10:46 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: I do understand. I'm not saying don't install the 32bit driver. I'm saying you need to install the 32bit driver from jessie-backports
[2016-05-25 20:10:56 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] ohhh ok my apologies
[2016-05-25 20:11:08 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] so that is why it removed the desktop?
[2016-05-25 20:11:13 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: but you are now just being noise. You have been told the issue, but don't be so confortational
[2016-05-25 20:11:39 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I'm still ntio sure you are correct.
[2016-05-25 20:11:39 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: I told you above why it removed the desktop (it was due to the meta package being removed because you had a conflict between the driver version in jessie-backports and jessie)
[2016-05-25 20:11:42 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but ok i'll try it....
[2016-05-25 20:11:44 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] somiaj, fwiw between you and me i actually installed steam last week
[2016-05-25 20:11:51 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] doesn't make sense to me.  but ok....so be it.
[2016-05-25 20:12:20 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2, and so you installed the 32 bit driver from the backports?
[2016-05-25 20:12:20 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: when you have both jessie and jessie-backports enabled apt has to decide which package to install.
[2016-05-25 20:12:23 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i mean lib
[2016-05-25 20:12:33 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, ohhhhh
[2016-05-25 20:12:45 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] so thats what it was i should of disabled the backport repo immediately after installing the driver
[2016-05-25 20:12:52 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: apt will default to the version from jessie, but you need the version from jessie-backports (As I keep saying). Which can be installed by running 'apt-get -t jessie-backports install libgl1-nvidia-glx:386'
[2016-05-25 20:13:10 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: no. YOu need to tell apt to isntall the jessie-backports version to match the one you want to use
[2016-05-25 20:13:22 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] ok sorry for my outburst
[2016-05-25 20:13:23 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: i.e. you want to install the 352 version, not the version in jessie as you said eariler.
[2016-05-25 20:14:15 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] still doesn't make sense to me,  but I shall see lol
[2016-05-25 20:14:36 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i'm starting to wonder now if i catually installed the amd one by accident haha
[2016-05-25 20:14:47 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: it is due to how packages depend on one another. And debian won't allow you to install two different versions of the nvidia drivers.
[2016-05-25 20:14:51 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] libgl1-fglrx-glx:i386
[2016-05-25 20:14:58 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] that might cause the problem i had...lol
[2016-05-25 20:15:01 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] but i'm not sure i did that.
[2016-05-25 20:15:28 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: you have been told your answer, no please refrain from all this noise. The ops are watching and being paitent.
[2016-05-25 20:15:29 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, it doesn't make sense to me i would need to install the library from the backports,  what diff does it make?
[2016-05-25 20:15:45 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] I think now maybe i installed the amd one by accident which screwed everything up.
[2016-05-25 20:15:56 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] its only thing i can think of right now...
[2016-05-25 20:16:05 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, well tks for getting me thinking anyways....
[2016-05-25 20:16:10 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] lol
[2016-05-25 20:16:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yep. another on /ignore...
[2016-05-25 20:16:13 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: no. The version in jessie is 340.96 and the version in jessie-backports is 352.79 (that is differnt right)?
[2016-05-25 20:16:20 -0500] [IdleGandalf in #debian] markybob, indeed
[2016-05-25 20:16:28 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, you are not understaind,  but tks for joggine my though process
[2016-05-25 20:16:43 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i believe what happened is, when i got to that step,  I installed the wrong libary.  i installed amd's instead of nvidia.
[2016-05-25 20:17:01 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] i probably copy and pasted the wrong thing in a rush
[2016-05-25 20:17:05 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] just like i hit y in a rush lol
[2016-05-25 20:17:08 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] doh!
[2016-05-25 20:17:11 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: anyways, I've taken to much tiem with this. Its time you move on and go fit your problem.
[2016-05-25 20:17:15 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] wonders how fglrx is an nvidia driver
[2016-05-25 20:17:18 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] somiaj, tks for trying.
[2016-05-25 20:17:24 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] jml2,  it obviously isn't,  fucktard
[2016-05-25 20:17:43 -0500] [Jaro in #debian] the 32 bit lib is alos not nescessary for driver,  only for steam.
[2016-05-25 20:18:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Jaro: i don't even like jml2 but he's not the fucktard here. c'mon.
[2016-05-25 20:18:26 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] Jaro: last warning, come back when you have cooled of and can use better langauge.
[2016-05-25 20:18:58 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] too much hate is not a good thing in general
[2016-05-25 20:19:15 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] it only works and divides users... so better to ignore poison i suppose
