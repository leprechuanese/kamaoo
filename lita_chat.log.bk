[2016-05-23 00:04:43 -0500] [babilen in #debian] n_blownapart: Check your current working directory for the file
[2016-05-23 00:04:48 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i loved it as a kid
[2016-05-23 00:05:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] hey polyzen
[2016-05-23 00:05:30 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] o/
[2016-05-23 00:05:36 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thanks man
[2016-05-23 00:06:36 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] it's probably like McDonald's
[2016-05-23 00:06:47 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] deceptively tasty, not at all filling
[2016-05-23 00:07:15 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] those fries kill my stomach every time
[2016-05-23 00:07:19 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] but I love em
[2016-05-23 00:07:25 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] haven't had McD's in ages..
[2016-05-23 00:07:39 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] our mcdonalds has very bad tasting ketchup.  thats totally uncool.  they get people to buy food from out of pity.  little do they know is that place is likely bankrupt and runs forever because of the treasury.  people have needs
[2016-05-23 00:08:14 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i suspect they have it in quantity and can't get rid of it.   definitely immoral.  even the bible says if it doesn't taste good, don't eat it.
[2016-05-23 00:08:32 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] people need their gov't-subsidized fastfood?
[2016-05-23 00:08:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] polyzen, find the right one and mcdonalds isn't bad
[2016-05-23 00:08:56 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] aw man

[2016-05-23 00:09:04 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] when it was good
[2016-05-23 00:09:24 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] chicken strips, wedges, biscuit.. damn I'm hugrny
[2016-05-23 00:09:26 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i just caught something i made a error in judgement.  i just know know pity happens. but for that ketchup?  its another that which should never be
[2016-05-23 00:09:26 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hungry now
[2016-05-23 00:09:38 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hehe
[2016-05-23 00:09:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] :D
[2016-05-23 00:10:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] if i eat more plentiful these days its my mind's "that thing" glad that says eat or you die.
[2016-05-23 00:10:28 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] its got a gland for that
[2016-05-23 00:11:12 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] because of my disability i have issues going to the grocery store.  only in this case would it be exhaustion from walking.  i can handle things like food and karaoke places
[2016-05-23 00:12:16 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] KFC has good mash potatos.  i remember that from childhood.  i'm sure the rest of their food is too i have an aversion against poultry i can't cure
[2016-05-23 00:12:44 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] ugh kfc
[2016-05-23 00:13:26 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] taco bell has a rocking bell grande nacho with taco, that taco's GOOD.  and those nachos awesome too.  with me it keeps me hungry, but i think my God for that gift.
[2016-05-23 00:13:45 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] more of a boston market kind of guy.
[2016-05-23 00:13:52 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats decent
[2016-05-23 00:14:00 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] haven't had that in a whle
[2016-05-23 00:14:02 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] while
[2016-05-23 00:14:06 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] in fact its probably great much of what i don't eat
[2016-05-23 00:14:07 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] their all-in-one bowls are well worth it.
[2016-05-23 00:14:19 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] they used to have awesome soups
[2016-05-23 00:14:24 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] I don't bother with stuff like Taco Bell because I'd need to eat too much of it then my stomach will be fucked
[2016-05-23 00:14:27 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] something like brocolli and cheese soup
[2016-05-23 00:14:43 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] that does sound good actually.
[2016-05-23 00:14:48 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] Chipotle is nom, but damn expensive
[2016-05-23 00:14:54 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] and even then sometimes you want more
[2016-05-23 00:14:56 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] true
[2016-05-23 00:14:57 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats why i'm eating.  i'm burning a bunch of calories and my brain tells me "arthur -- you need them"  its a survival thing
[2016-05-23 00:15:42 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i try to make my late-night munchies healthy(-er)
[2016-05-23 00:15:47 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] God bless you.  i'm sorry chipolte is out of your range.  i rely on my parents all the time and i spill it to them.  a meal costs 7 bucks
[2016-05-23 00:16:00 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats definitely awesome
[2016-05-23 00:16:14 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] beans, rice, and plantains
[2016-05-23 00:16:18 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] or carrots and hummus
[2016-05-23 00:16:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats what i was getting at earlier.  if you eat clean your whole body thanks you for it.
[2016-05-23 00:16:47 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] definitely
[2016-05-23 00:16:47 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] avis-, well, it's not about being out of my range
[2016-05-23 00:16:53 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] is just frugal
[2016-05-23 00:17:00 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] $9 for a meal is too much
[2016-05-23 00:17:07 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] actually, it's more like $10--$11
[2016-05-23 00:17:25 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i aim for ~$5
[2016-05-23 00:17:49 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] unless it's fancy night. ;)
[2016-05-23 00:17:50 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats fine.  i think thats awesome too.  my bottom line is what will pay for the meal that i want and need, parents pick it up.  when i said as rich as i am, that money isn't in my wallet.
[2016-05-23 00:17:53 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] hehe
[2016-05-23 00:18:30 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i think i can have that taco bell meal for $6.  thats one dollar off what my mom gives me.
[2016-05-23 00:18:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] but no wants to eat at the same place all the time
[2016-05-23 00:19:15 -0500] [polyzen in #debian-offtopic] can't see myself willingly going there again :p
[2016-05-23 00:20:03 -0500] [lider in #debian-es] hola...

[2016-05-23 00:20:52 -0500] [orome in #debian-es-offtopic] News from pdreadful: Penny Dreadful 3x04 A Blade of Grass <magnet:?xt=urn:btih:CCC6D30015C7F30D0C86C96EE27EFB0AB4BEEA6E&dn=Penny+Dreadful+S03E04+HDTV+x264+FLEET&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337>
[2016-05-23 00:20:52 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats reminds me of something.  i once checked into a hospital and said "i need a warehouse.  and walk around in darkness with minimal light and full medical staff and smokes etc.  something that traumatic happened to me that i'd know the cure for it, and yet, it doesn't match the trauma that keeps me with my beloved friends on irc that was even worse than that
[2016-05-23 00:21:29 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] the reason i knew it was the cure is because i was healed once that way after the first traumatic incident.  VERY UNCOOL.
[2016-05-23 00:22:40 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] fruits are awesome.  i know how to eat clean or at least for the win however without me being able to make it to the grocery store i've got to do my best.
[2016-05-23 00:23:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i love apples when i cut them up.  i have sensitive teeth.
[2016-05-23 00:23:34 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'm like awesome !!!!!!!!!!  these fruit decent

[2016-05-23 00:27:42 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] mom makes us pineapple water after everyone we cut open.  it feels very puerto rico, despite its only very slight change in taste
[2016-05-23 00:27:49 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] definitely it rocks the heck out of ya
[2016-05-23 00:28:00 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] lots of pineapple down there?
[2016-05-23 00:28:05 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i love grilled pineapple.
[2016-05-23 00:28:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] yes sir.
[2016-05-23 00:28:32 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats very good.  i like beef shiskabobs
[2016-05-23 00:28:58 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] i'm a veggie, but it is good with meats too.
[2016-05-23 00:29:06 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] provides a sweet/salty taste alongside.
[2016-05-23 00:29:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] please forgive me then its its an offense against ya.  i process comparative religion for the win, which makes me think of shinto.
[2016-05-23 00:30:21 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] nah it's not a religion for me. had some chicken soup at my sister's a couple months ago.
[2016-05-23 00:30:32 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] are the shintos veggie too?
[2016-05-23 00:30:37 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] absolutely
[2016-05-23 00:30:57 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] they don't allow themselves to walk on insects.  preservation of life to honor God is who they are
[2016-05-23 00:32:27 -0500] [nat0 in #debian-offtopic] interesting. most of my understanding of eastern philosophies is through taoism.
[2016-05-23 00:32:59 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats rearrange me until i'm sane.  are you chinese or asian by chance?

[2016-05-23 00:53:36 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: the server is on my server, I can plug usb devices,
[2016-05-23 00:53:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] nat0, i hear it causes the traffic to be backed up on the highway.  i rest my case
[2016-05-23 00:54:16 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] server is on our server room, I can plug usb devices, but none of the usb devices are recognized, even usb mouse and keyboard, I am accessing server remotely, using ssh

[2016-05-23 00:55:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] is anything plugged in right now? if you can't reboot the server, maybe you can try reloading the kernel modules
[2016-05-23 00:56:53 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, which module all kernel modules
[2016-05-23 00:58:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: no not everything. start with "lspci -k | grep -A2 USB"
[2016-05-23 00:59:09 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: http://paste.debian.net/695820/ yes, this is the output,
[2016-05-23 00:59:21 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i still consider myself your friend nat0 unless you can't handle it.  just because of separation of state and religion it doesn't mean they're not in bed together.  thats logical coherency.  thats why things must change in this country.
[2016-05-23 00:59:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: take a look at "lsmod | grep ehci"
[2016-05-23 01:00:17 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] hey avis-
[2016-05-23 01:00:18 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] and i take no offense either.

[2016-05-23 01:01:35 -0500] [lider in #debian-es] eso lo he elido pero ahora no lo encuentro que cosas,,,,
[2016-05-23 01:01:54 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thats a cool song jmcnaught.  do you know why they call themselves death ?  i'm put off in case its sinful.
[2016-05-23 01:02:00 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: when i do lsmod all those modules are already lodaded,
[2016-05-23 01:02:22 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] i'm as bold as death but no disrepect for my father
[2016-05-23 01:02:46 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] it was a rockin tune though
[2016-05-23 01:04:47 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] avis-: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_%28protopunk_band%29 they actually recorded a couple of gospel albums (with a different band name)
[2016-05-23 01:05:45 -0500] [avis- in #debian-offtopic] thanks jmcnaught
[2016-05-23 01:06:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: if everything USB related is nonresponsive then you could try removing and loading the modules using modprobe, but i don't know what's connected by USB on your system or what the consequences might be.
[2016-05-23 01:07:38 -0500] [slax0r in #debian] hello, I am having issues when booting back from hibernation, my previos xrandr setup is not retained, and when I re-run it, my whole system freezes, so I have to "push a pillow over its head" and boot it up normally again, here are some logs: xorg: http://laravel.io/bin/6LQyD messages: http://laravel.io/bin/QNK74 syslog: http://laravel.io/bin/zjqbv and the xranrd command: http://laravel.io/bin/1yDjw
[2016-05-23 01:07:42 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: from your error example it looks to me like some USB device is locked in a state that the kernel can't change for some reason
[2016-05-23 01:08:14 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: I connected the usb mouse, keyboard, and backupdrive, backupdrive is working but other usb devices is not working,
[2016-05-23 01:08:29 -0500] [slax0r in #debian] those logs provide me with very little info, or I am just reading them wrong, is there some other log I can inspect? oh right, kernel is 4.5.0 bpo from jessie backports, and the i5 skylake gfx
[2016-05-23 01:08:44 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, I have got some message  usb 2-1.6: reset full-speed USB device number 32 using ehc from my dmesg output
[2016-05-23 01:10:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] nix1947: keep researching error message i guess, reloading all the USB modules is not an option while the backup drive is being used
[2016-05-23 01:10:44 -0500] [nix1947 in #debian] jmcnaught: ok thank you for your guidance, I will
[2016-05-23 01:38:06 -0500] [avis- in #debian] what are possible methods for upgrading to a higher kernel in debian without compiling it yourself ?

[2016-05-23 01:40:55 -0500] [reev in #debian] how can i configure i3
[2016-05-23 01:43:02 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: You essentially select it in the list of window managers in gdm3. It should be listed there and there shouldn't be the need to update alternatives at all
[2016-05-23 01:44:43 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: how to select in list of window managers in gdm3
[2016-05-23 01:44:49 -0500] [reev in #debian] any command?
[2016-05-23 01:53:11 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: You type your user name and hit enter. Then there's a little gear shaped icon, click on it and select your session or, depending on your version, you might have a drop down menu

[2016-05-23 02:05:03 -0500] [Guest25335 in #debian] I'm contemplating to install Qubes OS (for their effortless setup)
[2016-05-23 02:10:41 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: thanks for that but I had automatic user login enabled in /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf which i turned off now but i get login by it
[2016-05-23 02:10:51 -0500] [reev in #debian] *still
[2016-05-23 02:13:09 -0500] [babilen in #debian] reev: I have never used that feature, but I guess that you have to somehow "select" your user's favourite session. It probably uses whatever you used last time.
[2016-05-23 02:14:07 -0500] [reev in #debian] babilen: okay I see what can i do
[2016-05-23 02:15:23 -0500] [babilen in #debian] But if you turn of automatic login, why is it still turned on?
[2016-05-23 03:14:11 -0500] [alakx in #debian] Hi, how can i check the build version of a  installed package via apt-get ? For example for the package openssl ?
[2016-05-23 03:21:06 -0500] [samneo in #debian] for checking installed package dpkg -l openssl
[2016-05-23 03:21:22 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] Hi, I'm trying to find a package. It has the same name in the jessie-backports and jessie repos but I want to use the backport one.
[2016-05-23 03:21:51 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] By default, the jone from jessie is installed. how can I force the repo to use?
[2016-05-23 03:21:58 -0500] [bhav in #debian] samneo hi
[2016-05-23 03:22:19 -0500] [samneo in #debian] apt-get provide information from repository
[2016-05-23 03:22:21 -0500] [samneo in #debian] like apt-cache showpkg openssl
[2016-05-23 03:23:38 -0500] [k_sze[work] in #debian] How do I figure out how udev has decided to name my tty device? i.e. why is my barcode scanner /dev/ttyACM0, and not some other tty name?
[2016-05-23 03:24:01 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] samneo: ok, I see that: it's the same info I got from the debian website. but how do I set that during the install?
[2016-05-23 03:24:09 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] so that it peaks the right one?
[2016-05-23 03:24:33 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] s/peak/pick
[2016-05-23 03:33:14 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] samneo: found with the aptitude terminal gui. idk with the command line but it's still ok
[2016-05-23 03:34:20 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: apt-get -t jessie-backports install "package"
[2016-05-23 03:35:05 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: that's why the -t option never worked ;) Promise I'll RTFM
[2016-05-23 03:35:17 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: what?
[2016-05-23 03:35:52 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: I was using aptitude install -t 5.200 package
[2016-05-23 03:36:05 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] with 5.200 the version of the package
[2016-05-23 03:36:23 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] you don't use version, you use the archive for -t
[2016-05-23 03:37:21 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] actually maybe you can, but did you try the target release instead?
[2016-05-23 03:37:42 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] i.e., jessie-backports
[2016-05-23 03:38:16 -0500] [ochurlaud-work in #debian] pingfloyd: I don't know what you mean by target release. but anyway, command is perfect. thx
[2016-05-23 03:47:46 -0500] [pingfloyd in #debian] ochurlaud-work: good to hear

[2016-05-23 04:20:07 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I have a weight balance connected to a tty (/dev/ttyUSBn); I can’t have it around every time, so I’d like to mimic it
[2016-05-23 04:20:39 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] is there a way to create a /dev/tty-dummy and have it sending stuff for me to test like a weight balance was plugged in?
[2016-05-23 04:23:52 -0500] [ancky in #debian] phz_: looks like you want a loopback serialport
[2016-05-23 04:24:08 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] well
[2016-05-23 04:24:15 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I need to send stuff in a file

[2016-05-23 04:34:50 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] is there a way to prevent the echo command from sending EOF?
[2016-05-23 04:37:39 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] not that I know of, no
[2016-05-23 04:37:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] only EOL, with -n

[2016-05-23 04:38:10 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] that’s boring
[2016-05-23 04:38:29 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I need to find a way to keep the pipe open
[2016-05-23 04:38:48 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I’m reading in the pipe in python
[2016-05-23 04:40:08 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] not sure how you could go about leaving "echo" running and being able to send more text through the same echo, though. echo would exit and break the pipe

[2016-05-23 05:53:13 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] I know you can download them with youtube-dl and play with mpv, maybe use a terminal browser like w3m to search for them
[2016-05-23 05:53:28 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] mpv can even play videos in your terminal
[2016-05-23 05:53:35 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] Really?

[2016-05-23 05:54:03 -0500] [plasmoduck in #debian] I might code one
[2016-05-23 05:54:23 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] shoulnd't be too difficult, we already have all tools, as I just said

[2016-05-23 06:48:35 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] to read what I’m typing in with a for line in fh
[2016-05-23 06:48:43 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I have to exit the tee program to get input
[2016-05-23 06:48:45 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] wtf?
[2016-05-23 06:48:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] is called "named pipe", and the reads will be buffered by default
[2016-05-23 06:49:07 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] until it reaches EOF?
[2016-05-23 06:49:18 -0500] [jelly in #debian] so if you write more than... 8192 bytes, I think, you'll get a read() out
[2016-05-23 06:49:22 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] I tried running it with stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 though
[2016-05-23 06:49:37 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] jelly: how can I change that behavior?
[2016-05-23 06:50:33 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dunno how that's done in python.  Actually I don't even remember if the buffering is write() side or read() side or both
[2016-05-23 06:51:09 -0500] [jelly in #debian] https://www.google.com/search?q=read+python+named+pipe+unbuffered  ? :-]

[2016-05-23 06:51:30 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] not that much information there
[2016-05-23 06:52:01 -0500] [ChrisWi in #debian] Megaf: Yes ... xen. I have 4 hosts ... but I see this only on two. the two with this log flodding have 2 targets (LUN) ... Any idea ?
[2016-05-23 06:52:09 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] jelly:
[2016-05-23 06:52:16 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] thanks for your help
[2016-05-23 06:53:04 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] nope, still buffering
[2016-05-23 06:53:06 -0500] [phz_ in #debian] ffs
[2016-05-23 06:54:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] phz_: at least one of the results suggests opening in binary mode, 'rb'
[2016-05-23 06:55:38 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] markybob: I don't see any candidate version https://gist.github.com/c4m4/9acb746fbcb8bc3c19cb18bfc927c8ee
[2016-05-23 06:56:58 -0500] [markybob in #debian] f0f4r: you have the latest. you're good. safe. i don't know what you're complaining about.
[2016-05-23 06:58:10 -0500] [sypher in #debian] f0f4r: You already have the latest 2.2 release with backported security fixes. Is there a particular vulnerability that you find hasn't been addressed?
[2016-05-23 06:58:41 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] heh, we keep getting mails from worried customers as well, "you're running a very old apache and php! why haven't you upgraded! it's not safe!"... all patches applied, of course.
[2016-05-23 06:59:01 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] people just see older versions and immediately assume things are insecure tbh
[2016-05-23 06:59:16 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] I would like to know if there is any cve that my webserver has
[2016-05-23 06:59:33 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] ChrisWi, maybe on #Xen ?
[2016-05-23 07:00:12 -0500] [markybob in #debian] f0f4r: you really just can't accept that security gets backported, eh? we're not going to do your meaningless work for you. google it.
[2016-05-23 07:00:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: use security-tracker.debian.org to look up any CVE and see if it's patched
[2016-05-23 07:00:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] also,
[2016-05-23 07:01:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian] !debsecan
[2016-05-23 07:01:02 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] methinks debsecan is a program that reports security advisories against programs installed on the host, similar to gentoo's glsa-check.  See http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/debsecan/.
[2016-05-23 07:01:50 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] jelly: ok, I will try to that site
[2016-05-23 07:02:50 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: if a patch for a known security issue is applied to the version in your debian release, you will usually see it mentioned in the changelog for the package.  zless /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/changelog.Debian.gz
[2016-05-23 07:05:05 -0500] [jelly in #debian] markybob: sometimes an admin has bosses, auditors or customers that want more concrete proof than "<markybob> f0f4r: you have the latest. you're good. safe. i don't know what you're complaining about."
[2016-05-23 07:06:10 -0500] [jelly in #debian] distro's security tracker is a useful reference for such a purpose
[2016-05-23 07:06:14 -0500] [irwiss in #debian] does dpkg care if something is a real folder or symlink? i'd like to move /etc/nginx/ to /www/nginx.conf/ and symlink it, it appears to work from nginx perspective, will i get in trouble with dpkg or other pitfalls?
[2016-05-23 07:06:47 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] Using debsecan I don't see any cve for apache
[2016-05-23 07:06:53 -0500] [f0f4r in #debian] Using debsecan I don't see any cve for apache
[2016-05-23 07:07:34 -0500] [jelly in #debian] irwiss: afair, you can only get in trouble after you purge all the packages that bring /etc/nginx directory, I _think_ that gets the symlink removed
[2016-05-23 07:07:40 -0500] [domth7 in #debian] Hi, my browser (Arora, surf, uzbl) crash, and i've found this messege in the term:"Illegal Instruction". My pc is too old, any ideas?
[2016-05-23 07:07:44 -0500] [ChrisWi in #debian] Megaf: ok will try ... you have no idea about those messages to get rid off ?
[2016-05-23 07:08:00 -0500] [Megaf in #debian] nope
[2016-05-23 07:08:36 -0500] [jelly in #debian] f0f4r: that means it's all patched up, as far as debian knows
[2016-05-23 07:10:11 -0500] [jelly in #debian] assuming you're using debsecan right.  Mine just found something very very old on this machine...
[2016-05-23 07:10:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] ii  apache-common               1.3.34-4.1+etch1   i386               support files for all Apache webservers
[2016-05-23 07:12:28 -0500] [irwiss in #debian] jelly: that makes sense i guess, not planning on purging but backup is on the roadmap once it's settled, thanks
[2016-05-23 07:26:07 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources
[2016-05-23 07:26:20 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] you may try to continue without a kernel, and manually install your own kernel later. this is only recommended for experts
[2016-05-23 07:26:33 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
[2016-05-23 07:26:58 -0500] [digidog in #debian] Hi hello everyone, I am sort of confused: Laptop ACER V3 772G  suddenly reboots without warning randomly with Debian 8 installed, no matter which application runs or if CPU etc is high or not.
[2016-05-23 07:28:34 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] digidog: mcelog installed? That might help detecting a HW issue. Sounds more like a HW problem to me.
[2016-05-23 07:33:47 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, and it worked well before?
[2016-05-23 07:35:34 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] or did you just install debian?
[2016-05-23 07:36:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] ChrisH: cruncher: hard to say, its a laptop I have prepared for somebody who didnt used it a lot. now it stands here and I test it and it seems sth wrong. cpu goes up 72% when I try to remove hplip. maybe thats the devil
[2016-05-23 07:37:30 -0500] [digidog in #debian] shutdown mostly is regarding overhead (security stop)
[2016-05-23 07:37:48 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] so you just installed it, it works, but has high cpu usage, and suddenly reboots (not poweroff)
[2016-05-23 07:39:45 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, overhead? you mean overheat? so it turns off, not reboots
[2016-05-23 07:40:06 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: Isry, yes I was referring to heat.
[2016-05-23 07:40:21 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] then i guess its a hw problem
[2016-05-23 07:40:22 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: it sometomes shuts down, sometimes reboots
[2016-05-23 07:40:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: I have remove hplip now and now cpu usage goes down to 55
[2016-05-23 07:40:56 -0500] [digidog in #debian] remove(d)
[2016-05-23 07:41:05 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] so what is using the cpu?
[2016-05-23 07:41:34 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but basically its clear, somethig is using the cpu, it gets hot, and as it cant cool it enough it turns off
[2016-05-23 07:41:41 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] basically you have 2 problems
[2016-05-23 07:41:46 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: hplip 12 %. maybe its more obvious today since here are 30 degress so the room is much warmer
[2016-05-23 07:42:20 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] yes, that too :) if you would sit in alaska it wouldnt happen probably :P
[2016-05-23 07:42:34 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: now it runs normal after removing hplip -> http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html
[2016-05-23 07:42:43 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: :-D
[2016-05-23 07:43:05 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] well, if you identified hplip as the culprit...
[2016-05-23 07:43:29 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] im particularly interested because i was thinking to get the E5-773 laptop, and was curious how it works with debian
[2016-05-23 07:43:38 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: I agree with you, I think also there are more then one issue. maybe hplip messed up somehow and eats a lot, but thats with 12% not issue enogh for the overheat actually
[2016-05-23 07:44:57 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] hey, /proc/cpuinfo says both cores of my cpu are running at around 230MHz (this is a 3.3GHz machine at full load) - what could this mean?
[2016-05-23 07:45:41 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: any good hw test utisl for debian to check if all cores runs ok etc ?
[2016-05-23 07:45:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it means it's on
[2016-05-23 07:46:02 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] markybob: but why is the frequency so low?
[2016-05-23 07:46:03 -0500] [dTal in #debian] I was gonna say that they've been clocked down for powersave, but that seems unusually low
[2016-05-23 07:46:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i have chrome alone using 26% right now
[2016-05-23 07:46:23 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] markybob: the cores themselves are running at 230 MHz
[2016-05-23 07:47:27 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] dTal: I was thinking it's hardware failure, as I do recall a weird message about overheating appearing once in dmesg - but not since, and I've even cleaned the fans, and changed nothing in BIOS...
[2016-05-23 07:47:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i've never seen that. the computer would always shut itself off if it got so hot it had to run that slowly
[2016-05-23 07:48:26 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, did you try what ChrisH suggested?
[2016-05-23 07:49:04 -0500] [dTal in #debian] Trieste: if you switch your CPU governor to "Performace" does it go to full speed?
[2016-05-23 07:49:15 -0500] [dTal in #debian] maybe your CPU just supports unusually low clock speeds
[2016-05-23 07:49:19 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] dTal: how would I do that?
[2016-05-23 07:50:12 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] (by the way, the load is roughly about at 2.5)
[2016-05-23 07:51:05 -0500] [dTal in #debian] depends on your chipset, usually you can cat something somewhere in /sys
[2016-05-23 07:51:35 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: sry, that was run out of the view here
[2016-05-23 07:52:05 -0500] [digidog in #debian] ChrisH: sry, I didn't kep in mind your answer. I will check
[2016-05-23 07:52:18 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] ooh, so there is something interesting in dmesg after all
[2016-05-23 07:52:43 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] "Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled" and "Package temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled"
[2016-05-23 07:52:58 -0500] [Trieste in #debian] but what the heck
[2016-05-23 07:53:42 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] digidog, you could try the intel processor diagnostic tool from Intel
[2016-05-23 07:53:43 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] http://www.tcsscreening.com/files/users/IPDT_LiveUSB/index.html
[2016-05-23 07:53:49 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but i dont know if it works with debian
[2016-05-23 07:54:08 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] but honestly i doubt the cpu is "broken"

[2016-05-23 08:26:51 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I guess blkid might be from busybox?

[2016-05-23 08:28:11 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] how to install linux kernel?
[2016-05-23 08:28:16 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] apt-get ?
[2016-05-23 08:28:23 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] apt-get install linux-image
[2016-05-23 08:28:30 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] I think
[2016-05-23 08:28:34 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] (or just "apt" on jessie)
[2016-05-23 08:28:47 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] but if you're already running Debian, you already have a kernel installed :)
[2016-05-23 08:28:50 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ...I couldn't get used to "just apt" :)
[2016-05-23 08:28:57 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] fireba11, what?? OMG
[2016-05-23 08:29:07 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: ah well ... it got a progess bar(tm) :-D
[2016-05-23 08:29:14 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] :D
[2016-05-23 08:29:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: try "file -s" with proceeding full path to the disk/part
[2016-05-23 08:29:34 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] naptastic: No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources. you may try to continue without a kernel, and manually install your own kernel later. this is only recommended for experts
[2016-05-23 08:29:35 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] it's more that apt-get is kinda hardwired when I'm typing
[2016-05-23 08:29:36 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I dont have "file" :(
[2016-05-23 08:30:10 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] Package linux-image is not avaiiable, but is referred to by another package
[2016-05-23 08:30:10 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] so much that if I need to use apt-cache, I already typed apt-get and then have to backspace 4 times and type cache ;)
[2016-05-23 08:30:13 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] FinalX, yep... and RHEL / CentOS are going from yum -> dnf in a couple of years...
[2016-05-23 08:30:15 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] e: package linux-image has no intallation candidate
[2016-05-23 08:30:32 -0500] [digidog in #debian] cruncher: thanks for all the cues. well yeah I doubt its the cpu two. but I will try more hw test utils and check if anything intersting pops up and let you know (because of ACER)
[2016-05-23 08:30:32 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: also it seems you still need things like apt-cache
[2016-05-23 08:30:49 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: how did you manage that?
[2016-05-23 08:30:54 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, what version of Debian is this? `cat /etc/debian_version`
[2016-05-23 08:31:01 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
[2016-05-23 08:31:03 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] also, yeah, what did you do? :|
[2016-05-23 08:31:07 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ok
[2016-05-23 08:31:09 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] i installed it
[2016-05-23 08:31:15 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] and it said this
[2016-05-23 08:31:15 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] oops, which reminds me, I have to send an e-mail back to the guy who helped me when I e-mailed the APT-maintainers.. I'm awful, didn't even thank him o.O
[2016-05-23 08:31:17 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: oh well. does "dmesg" show you any hints?
[2016-05-23 08:31:29 -0500] [gypsymauro in #debian] it seems that newver versions of debian has changed rourint priority ? on older debian I've 192.168.1.0 routing then 0.0.0.0 on newer I've before 0.0.0.0 then 192.168.1.0, how can I change this behavioour?
[2016-05-23 08:32:00 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: nope :(
[2016-05-23 08:32:13 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, what's the output of `uname -a` ?
[2016-05-23 08:32:14 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: strace the mount? idk
[2016-05-23 08:32:36 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] no strace either :P
[2016-05-23 08:32:42 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] naptastic linux debian 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt25-1 (2016-03-06) x86_64 GNU/Linux
[2016-05-23 08:32:43 -0500] [defanor in #debian] j`ey: stat? ls?
[2016-05-23 08:33:09 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] ls works, and shows both the /dev/sda1 and /mnt/x exist
[2016-05-23 08:33:27 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] AlexPortable, ok, try `apt install linux-image-3.16.0-4-amd64`
[2016-05-23 08:33:40 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] naptastic: not that good an idea
[2016-05-23 08:33:45 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] thanks that worked
[2016-05-23 08:33:50 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] O_O
[2016-05-23 08:33:51 -0500] [dvs in #debian] too late
[2016-05-23 08:34:03 -0500] [telecity in #debian] mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/x -> "no such file or directory"?
[2016-05-23 08:34:07 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey:
[2016-05-23 08:34:14 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] telecity: does x exists?
[2016-05-23 08:34:22 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: yes
[2016-05-23 08:34:46 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: naptastic: you want some soet of meta package usually like linux-image-amd64
[2016-05-23 08:34:50 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] "mounting /dev/sda1 on /mnt/x failed: no such file or directory"
[2016-05-23 08:35:11 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: can you cd to /mnt/x?
[2016-05-23 08:35:25 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] is there still a nspluginwrapper package somewhere? Or is there any other way to run 32bit java app in 64bit OS?
[2016-05-23 08:35:37 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: yup
[2016-05-23 08:35:49 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] fireba11: that progress bar is creeping me out
[2016-05-23 08:36:00 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] just gave it a go :)
[2016-05-23 08:36:02 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: :-D
[2016-05-23 08:36:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: cat < /dev/sda1 > /tmp/a0 = and this works?
[2016-05-23 08:37:13 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] that did work (except it failed with run out of space on device error)
[2016-05-23 08:37:25 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: there are some other new things like apt update reports back if there are things you could upgrade
[2016-05-23 08:37:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: yea should've used /dev/null.. my bad
[2016-05-23 08:37:56 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] fireba11: yeah, I noticed, pretty sweet. then again, it's only for my own server.. most servers are managed through puppet with unattended upgrades and all, too :)
[2016-05-23 08:38:12 -0500] [telecity in #debian] j`ey: i think you should message "jelly", i'm useless further
[2016-05-23 08:38:14 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] telecity: going to reboot, think that messed stuff up
[2016-05-23 08:39:28 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] FinalX: depends. i got 7 debian servers but all with very different tasks. i upgrade manually because some upgrades might require a restart of a 3rd party application of a maintenance window. puppet is for several servers with similar or identical tasks
[2016-05-23 08:40:52 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] sure, we have that too, but most things can be upgraded without any issue
[2016-05-23 08:41:06 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] database software i won't, obviously
[2016-05-23 08:41:22 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] openssh/openssl etc however can and should be upgraded asap
[2016-05-23 08:42:01 -0500] [defanor in #debian] j`ey: is that device listed in fstab?
[2016-05-23 08:42:21 -0500] [j`ey in #debian] I would guess not, since it's in the installer
[2016-05-23 08:42:25 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] fireba11: can't i install that after reboot?
[2016-05-23 08:42:28 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] or best to just reinstall now
[2016-05-23 08:42:36 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] saludos
[2016-05-23 08:42:52 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] acabo de instalar xrdp en un escritorio KDE4-FULL
[2016-05-23 08:43:01 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] pero no me funciona
[2016-05-23 08:43:08 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] y no encuentro informacion en la web
[2016-05-23 08:43:12 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] de como ponerlo a trabajar
[2016-05-23 08:44:46 -0500] [dvs in #debian] AlexPortable, reinstall?  You can install linux-image-amd64 and it won't interfere with anything
[2016-05-23 08:44:53 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] well i have now the special package
[2016-05-23 08:44:54 -0500] [fireba11 in #debian] AlexPortable: it's not THAT important ... it just will prevent your kernel from getting dist-upgraded with the newxt new release automatically if you amnually install a specific kernel
[2016-05-23 08:44:55 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] should i remove it again?
[2016-05-23 08:45:10 -0500] [AlexPortable in #debian] oh
[2016-05-23 08:46:47 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] usa reminna
[2016-05-23 08:46:50 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] o como se llame asimoviano
[2016-05-23 08:47:19 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] x4w3: xrdp no es un cliente
[2016-05-23 08:47:22 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] es un servidor
[2016-05-23 08:47:53 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] :) si verdad
[2016-05-23 08:47:55 -0500] [darxmurf in #debian] okay, mysqldump + vim = yay

[2016-05-23 08:48:16 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] telecity: vim can do regex replaces.
[2016-05-23 08:48:21 -0500] [x4w3 in #debian-es] es que instalar xrdp en linux es raro :P
[2016-05-23 08:48:23 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] vim can do sed stuff fine, too :)
[2016-05-23 08:48:26 -0500] [asimoviano in #debian-es] porque tengo acceso a xrdp

[2016-05-23 08:48:32 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] arguably easier than with sed tbh

[2016-05-23 09:29:23 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] i have two debian machines that when i update kernel to +4.x
[2016-05-23 09:29:33 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] it hangs on boot in services like bind
[2016-05-23 09:29:40 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] very wierd, anyone has a clue on that?
[2016-05-23 09:30:05 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] i have udev/kmod/init scripts, and almost all packages on the system updated
[2016-05-23 09:30:16 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] very odd, never happened such thing to me
[2016-05-23 09:41:33 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Which release are you running on both of them?
[2016-05-23 09:41:57 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] petn-randall: sid
[2016-05-23 09:42:13 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: What CPUs do they have?
[2016-05-23 09:42:20 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] it's something only with this two machines, all others work OK

[2016-05-23 09:43:34 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: You can add remove 'quiet splash' from the kernel parameter line in grub, maybe that will show you some more information.
[2016-05-23 09:44:23 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] petn-randall: im using lilo, no splash, i see all messages
[2016-05-23 09:44:31 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Also check /var/log/daemon.log for any errors. And 'systemd-analyze critical-chain' to check where exactly it hangs.
[2016-05-23 09:44:37 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] no splash or framebuffer or so
[2016-05-23 09:45:00 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] [sr]: Since most things are started in parallel, it may seem that it hangs because of A, but in reality it's because of B.
[2016-05-23 09:45:32 -0500] [[sr] in #debian] can be a fact
[2016-05-23 09:49:23 -0500] [defanor in #debian] i consider using debian packages to deploy/update programs at work, but those programs usually require packages that are either not present or too old in debian repositories, so they use language-dependent package managers. some of those are compiled and linked statically with the libraries, and others are interpreted. should i just hack things in the `rules` file, is there a better way, or is it a bad idea to use deb packages for that?
[2016-05-23 09:50:40 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] I am having issues in a wheezy install where titlebar and title fonts are showing as rectangle boxes. Obviously it seems like a fonts issue or a locale issue, but nothing I've done seems to fix it. Anyone have experience with this issue?
[2016-05-23 09:52:08 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] defanor: I try to use Debian packages where I can, simply because I don't have to track security updates in those packages. If you can't use them, because they're too old or built with different flags than you need, you have to weave them into the deployment part of your system. There's really no general best practice for that, as every language cooks their own stuff.
[2016-05-23 09:52:17 -0500] [defanor in #debian] LowValueTarget: try to set another font in your window manager, and/or check its logs, maybe
[2016-05-23 09:52:29 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] defanor: i've done that
[2016-05-23 09:52:32 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] nothing of note in the logs
[2016-05-23 09:52:59 -0500] [LowValueTarget in #debian] Also, if it helps, this just started happening on a 6-month old install

[2016-05-23 10:09:07 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] but then you still have a 64 bit browser
[2016-05-23 10:09:20 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: Probably not, depends on the details.
[2016-05-23 10:09:31 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: Is there a reason you want to install a 32 bit java?
[2016-05-23 10:09:32 -0500] [parcs in #debian] uh oh, apt wants to remove libc6
[2016-05-23 10:09:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] petn-randall: yes, I need to run webex
[2016-05-23 10:09:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] who would have a need for that!
[2016-05-23 10:09:48 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] !tell parcs about bat
[2016-05-23 10:09:50 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] and webex doesn't support 64 bit java
[2016-05-23 10:10:22 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] can't you just install a 32bit browser as well?
[2016-05-23 10:10:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] then how do I choose to launch the 32 bit browser for webex and not for the rest?
[2016-05-23 10:11:11 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] not sure you can install both at the same time, but if you can just use the full path..
[2016-05-23 10:11:23 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] won't they have both the same name?
[2016-05-23 10:11:29 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] probably
[2016-05-23 10:11:34 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] if I do apt-get install iceweasel:i386
[2016-05-23 10:11:49 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] it will conflict with iceweasel:amd64
[2016-05-23 10:12:15 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] yeah, so pick one. or use a vm, or a different browser, or avoid such software..
[2016-05-23 10:12:35 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I cannot avoid that software, and I am running in a VM atm, but I expected a cleaner solution
[2016-05-23 10:12:45 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] or bootstrap i386 debian into a dir and run it chrooted :P
[2016-05-23 10:13:26 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] at some point, there was nspluginwrapper which allowed to run 32bit java in 64 bit proxy, but the package deosn't exist anymore
[2016-05-23 10:13:37 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] fwiw, my first search result for that has a guide for ubuntu that only installs a few 32bit libs
[2016-05-23 10:14:14 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] s/proxy/browser/
[2016-05-23 10:15:23 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I tried to install the 32bit libs in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ and then start it, but that fails
[2016-05-23 10:15:57 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] (and yes, I did ldconfig)
[2016-05-23 10:16:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] what about libc6-i386 ?
[2016-05-23 10:16:55 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] or was that the one you tried?
[2016-05-23 10:17:19 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] I did that, and also installed all the java libss listed in the ldd of webex
[2016-05-23 10:17:23 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ah
[2016-05-23 10:17:41 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] and compiling the old nspluginwrapper fails on me too
[2016-05-23 10:17:42 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: It's probably easier and less error prone to just maintain a 32-bit chroot with the necessary packages.
[2016-05-23 10:17:43 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] //usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgthread-2.0.so.0: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
[2016-05-23 10:18:01 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] yes, I think it's the only way to go
[2016-05-23 10:18:19 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] \renaud: You just need the 32 bit browser installed, it can run under your (non-chrooted) X11.
[2016-05-23 10:18:51 -0500] [\renaud in #debian] wasn't there a package to populate a chroot?

[2016-05-23 10:29:16 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Hi, a short question as I'm not entirely sure how it's handled. If you login via SSH using only a key file does that mean the user you're logging in with doesn't have a password?
[2016-05-23 10:29:34 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] no, they are seperate
[2016-05-23 10:29:51 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] a user can have a password, and have an authorized ssh key, or both, or neither
[2016-05-23 10:30:28 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] password authentication can be disabled in the ssh daemon, so only authorized ssh key auth is allowed, or vice versa, or to allow both
[2016-05-23 10:33:50 -0500] [telecity in #debian] don't forget to disable ChallengeResponse, too
[2016-05-23 10:33:56 -0500] [telecity in #debian] if you're going for the password
[2016-05-23 10:35:17 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Ok. So that part should be ok. The real issue I'm working on is understanding the mail-server configuration. As much as it shames me it seems like someone is trying to send spam using my mail server and i can't really tell why (yet).
[2016-05-23 10:36:14 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: misconfiguration sounds like a likely scenario
[2016-05-23 10:36:33 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: which MTA?
[2016-05-23 10:37:48 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Probably, yes. it's postfix and I am seeing some Probably. "Relay access denied;" messages. I've pretty much tracked it down to a line which looks like a valid login. The quesiton is if for some reason the password isn't checked for the SMTP access or if the password for that account was leaked somehow. Both cases are pretty ... bad.
[2016-05-23 10:38:24 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] telecity: Either your MTA is set up as an open relay (naughty!), or some user space program is sending them (you may have some broken web application running on it?), or you've got a trojan.

[2016-05-23 10:38:44 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] telecity: sorry, wrong autocomplete
[2016-05-23 10:38:50 -0500] [telecity in #debian] petn-randall: np
[2016-05-23 10:39:48 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Meh... all pretty bad. I guess it's PW changeing time ... for all accounts on that server. Thanks for hints and helping clearing it up so quickly. :)
[2016-05-23 10:39:48 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Check /var/log/mail.log where the actual spam comes from. You can also paste those lines + some context to http://paste.debian.net for us to see.
[2016-05-23 10:40:12 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Do you know it's from any user on that system?
[2016-05-23 10:40:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] PrimalHunter: you asked a question about passwords at first.. using PAM for your MTA?
[2016-05-23 10:40:45 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] PrimalHunter: you can have postfix use a different mechanism
[2016-05-23 10:43:38 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Those are the parts in mail.log that I found that show when the spam starts http://paste.debian.net/hidden/98011cf2/

[2016-05-23 10:49:36 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Looks like your SASL setup is somehow broken. Is seth@sturdy-byte.net a valid user on that system?
[2016-05-23 10:49:47 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] yes, it would be
[2016-05-23 10:50:15 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] PrimalHunter: Looks like that user's password was somehow retrieved. Should this user be allowed to send mail?
[2016-05-23 10:50:17 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] yesterday's word-cloud: https://ptpb.pw/4Mv5.png
[2016-05-23 10:51:44 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] yes, I guess one of the other services had to be compromised than. At least I never changed the password after generting the user. That is concerning. *sigh* A lot of work is waiting. \o/
[2016-05-23 10:54:12 -0500] [PrimalHunter in #debian] Thanks for all the help and see you all later. Havea nice day!

[2016-05-23 11:22:30 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ugh, that moment where you're in mc moving files over and you accidentally cancel it when a 20 GB file is nearly done copying over.
[2016-05-23 11:22:32 -0500] [brutus_ in #debian-offtopic] lol ok
[2016-05-23 11:22:36 -0500] [brutus_ in #debian-offtopic] who is that
[2016-05-23 11:23:08 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Some Croatian politician, a minister or something
[2016-05-23 11:23:30 -0500] [brutus_ in #debian-offtopic] now i got more questions

[2016-05-23 11:24:10 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Are you saying that gentleman is of questionable nature?

[2016-05-23 11:26:05 -0500] [brutus_ in #debian-offtopic] i have no clue
[2016-05-23 11:36:23 -0500] [brutus_ in #debian-offtopic] as far as i'm considered, all politicians are of questionable nature
[2016-05-23 11:37:11 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] FinalX, what is with that moment? i hope you know you can resume file copying
[2016-05-23 11:37:27 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] of course only if oyu pressed "keep" the partially copied file
[2016-05-23 11:37:37 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] ;-)
[2016-05-23 11:38:28 -0500] [Dean-b in #debian] Upgrading to unstable. Shitting it. Any nightmares I shoud be prepared for?
[2016-05-23 11:38:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Dean-b: we don't support unstable. read /topic
[2016-05-23 11:38:57 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] Dean-b, if its a fresh install there shouldnt be any problems
[2016-05-23 11:38:58 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] Dean-b: s/Upgrading/Downgrading/ and i'd agree...
[2016-05-23 11:39:17 -0500] [cruncher in #debian] just a little info, but as markybob says, not supported here
[2016-05-23 11:39:33 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !debian-next
[2016-05-23 11:39:33 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] #debian-next is the channel for testing/unstable support on the OFTC network (irc.oftc.net), *not* on Freenode.  If you get "Cannot join #debian-next (Channel is invite only)." it means you did not read it's on irc.oftc.net.
[2016-05-23 11:39:37 -0500] [likevinyl in #debian-es-offtopic] uhhh llegó la moda de graficar...
[2016-05-23 11:39:43 -0500] [Dean-b in #debian] Not asking for support. I'm pretty used to debian and linux in general. Just wondering if i've opened a can of worms :P .
[2016-05-23 11:39:44 -0500] [likevinyl in #debian-es-offtopic] ... otra vez.
[2016-05-23 11:40:16 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Dean-b: that's support. we don't know what's going on with sid because we don't use it. so you go to the proper channel and ask them
[2016-05-23 11:41:38 -0500] [Dean-b in #debian] Awh balls not unstable. I'm upgrading to testing. Stretch not sid.
[2016-05-23 11:41:50 -0500] [Dean-b in #debian] Not need to be so uppity in any case.
[2016-05-23 11:42:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Dean-b: did you not read? /topic or what the bot said? stretch support is also not here
[2016-05-23 11:42:54 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] What a lovely day it was! The lawn is mowed, the sparrows bathed in the sand, the squirrels collected nuts, the buzzards collected squirrels - in short: yin - yang == 0
[2016-05-23 11:43:58 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] I watched a heron stand still on a rock for more than an hour and it didn't get bored
[2016-05-23 11:44:10 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] herons are surprising
[2016-05-23 11:45:06 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] herons are a bit like politicians
[2016-05-23 11:45:36 -0500] [Dean-b in #debian] nce again I do not require support. Asking you if you have ever tied your shoes is not the same as asking you to tie mine.
[2016-05-23 11:46:39 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Dean-b: i've used testing before and it's been fine. i've used before and it's utterly broken everything. i cant tell you it's current state. they can.
[2016-05-23 11:47:49 -0500] [zinx in #debian] it's very likely that you should not be running testing
[2016-05-23 11:48:05 -0500] [zinx in #debian] if you want bleeding edge, go with sid.  if you want something that won't break, go with stable
[2016-05-23 11:48:17 -0500] [markybob in #debian] s/likely/obvious
[2016-05-23 11:51:00 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] zinx: sid is not bleeding edge ...
[2016-05-23 11:51:13 -0500] [zinx in #debian] teraflops: it's as bleeding as debian gets
[2016-05-23 11:51:22 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no it's not
[2016-05-23 11:51:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] but please god teraflops don't mention what is. we don't need that :/
[2016-05-23 11:51:37 -0500] [zinx in #debian] markybob: you're thinking of something that's not debian.
[2016-05-23 11:51:40 -0500] [eladhen_ in #debian] It makes you bleed
[2016-05-23 11:52:01 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] markybob: it's ok, just pointing a fact
[2016-05-23 11:52:19 -0500] [zinx in #debian] anyway, the other one is reserved for things that are known to be broken :P

[2016-05-23 11:55:16 -0500] [Nitori in #debian] wondering if someone had a similar issue with debian testing

[2016-05-23 12:08:38 -0500] [radw in #debian] hello, I continue having issues mouting a nfs share from debian to a freenfs server
[2016-05-23 12:09:21 -0500] [radw in #debian] as you can see, the server give me rcpinfo, but the authentication failed (even there isnt any  in the server): https://justpaste.it/uk7b
[2016-05-23 12:10:20 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] says access denied by server, are you sure the client's ip that it's connecting from is allowed?
[2016-05-23 12:10:26 -0500] [mutante in #debian] "access denied" sounds like there is
[2016-05-23 12:10:48 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] access denied does not necessarily come down to a user/pass problem
[2016-05-23 12:11:00 -0500] [mutante in #debian]  /etc/hosts.allow ?
[2016-05-23 12:11:25 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] you say "there isn't any on the server", but by default the nfs server does demand you specify the allowed ranges in /etc/exports
[2016-05-23 12:12:31 -0500] [radw in #debian] in this case, freenfs is v3  and does not require a user/password
[2016-05-23 12:12:47 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] please read what I wrote
[2016-05-23 12:12:54 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] that's exactly what I just said
[2016-05-23 12:13:01 -0500] [riskc in #debian] I've got some trouble since I once filled my root partition to the brim... :-(
[2016-05-23 12:13:03 -0500] [radw in #debian] i can allow in   /etc/hosts.allow, hoever I tried it also but didint work
[2016-05-23 12:13:28 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] riskc: ouch :( freeing some space should usually get things going again pretty decently, though
[2016-05-23 12:13:39 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] radw: read what i wrote, i even said where.
[2016-05-23 12:14:18 -0500] [riskc in #debian] FinalX: no, got gigs free now but still got trouble. For example, I don't get sound for selected videos that worked before. Strange problem?
[2016-05-23 12:14:34 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] yes
[2016-05-23 12:14:39 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] for example, mkdir nfs; echo '/nfs 192.168.153.226(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)' >> /etc/exports
[2016-05-23 12:14:48 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] and right there, there's the IP that's allowed to connect
[2016-05-23 12:14:56 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] nothing to do with hosts.allow or usernames/passwords
[2016-05-23 12:14:56 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] They thought he was Kenny
[2016-05-23 12:15:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] you bastards!
[2016-05-23 12:15:27 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] riskc: ugh, wouldn't know really; I mostly use it for servers.. tried restarting all services (or reboot, which does essentially the same)?
[2016-05-23 12:16:40 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: wb, glad you didn't die :3
[2016-05-23 12:16:59 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] da knife is on ma thrrrroat
[2016-05-23 12:17:08 -0500] [radw in #debian] FinalX: i just loaded rpcbind : NFS server IP  to /etc/hosts.allow and give me the same error
[2016-05-23 12:17:16 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] nah
[2016-05-23 12:17:44 -0500] [f-a in #debian] (alsa) I would like to capture what comes out of my soundcard to, say, record it to a test.ogg file. I played around with alsamixer and audacity with little luck. Any hint?
[2016-05-23 12:17:46 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] ..........
[2016-05-23 12:17:48 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] went to a juggling weekend... must have caught something from the food or the people or the animals
[2016-05-23 12:18:09 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] because I spent a lovely night vomiting and running to the restroom
[2016-05-23 12:18:27 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] the problem is _NOT_ on the Debian client machine, but on the FreeNFS-server not allowing the IP in the NFS-server itself through /etc/exports, _not_ in hosts.allow, like I just mentioned 2 times
[2016-05-23 12:18:30 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] so I got sick-off
[2016-05-23 12:18:47 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that's what you get for juggling random animals.
[2016-05-23 12:19:01 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] running from a tent with 6°C outside
[2016-05-23 12:19:12 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I can heartily recommend that for exercise
[2016-05-23 12:19:35 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] not
[2016-05-23 12:20:37 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] but while rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated...
[2016-05-23 12:20:47 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] the maintainer of calibre is missing?
[2016-05-23 12:22:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] is he? has there been news?
[2016-05-23 12:22:41 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I thought of writing some bug reports on it...
[2016-05-23 12:22:49 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] but first looked at the bug page
[2016-05-23 12:22:56 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] bugs over bugs which have no reply
[2016-05-23 12:23:16 -0500] [radw in #debian] FinalX: but why in debian as nfs client not work, but for  others nfs clients work (like vmware esxi)?
[2016-05-23 12:23:36 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] and it's probably "she", as the bug page says "Miriam"
[2016-05-23 12:24:19 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] you never know!
[2016-05-23 12:25:07 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] except sometimes, you do know
[2016-05-23 12:25:48 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I sometimes think: It's amazing, the things you know
[2016-05-23 12:25:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] sounds like CMoT is volunteering
[2016-05-23 12:27:09 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] no, that sounded like a pratchett dialogue... at least the last 3 lines

[2016-05-23 12:33:35 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] jelly, looking at those bugs, she probably died from exhaustion
[2016-05-23 12:34:42 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] cmhobbs, shish shiddy isha womman?
[2016-05-23 12:35:33 -0500] [thiolliere in #debian] my cpu temperature goes from 40 to ~80 fan almost not work. then fan works fullpower and temperature decrease to 40. I want better control to my fan to activate them a little so it is never noisy. but pwmconfig tell me that there is pwm-capable sensors module installed. can I control my fans and how ?
[2016-05-23 12:35:57 -0500] [cmhobbs in #debian-offtopic] ha
[2016-05-23 12:36:19 -0500] [thiolliere in #debian] *there is no pwm-capable modules instaled*
[2016-05-23 12:36:30 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] in time you may learn, that the reverse can also be true
[2016-05-23 12:37:11 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] have you arrived at any voonerables?
[2016-05-23 12:37:59 -0500] [Akram in #debian] Hi guys
[2016-05-23 12:38:33 -0500] [Akram in #debian] I am helping a friend whose server has been hacked: he had a very old version of Debian: 6.0
[2016-05-23 12:38:54 -0500] [Akram in #debian] I made 2 upgrades
[2016-05-23 12:39:05 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and now, I can't but: I am stuck on grub page
[2016-05-23 12:39:14 -0500] [Akram in #debian] s/but/boot
[2016-05-23 12:39:30 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] maybe back up everything important and reinstall? who knows what was done with the server since it was hacked.
[2016-05-23 12:39:47 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] may be persistent call back shells left or back doors?
[2016-05-23 12:40:00 -0500] [Akram in #debian] markus_: good advice, I want to restore the service for now, and take more time to do the reinstall
[2016-05-23 12:40:20 -0500] [Akram in #debian] I need help on getting grub2 work back
[2016-05-23 12:40:32 -0500] [Akram in #debian] I think that the partitions where ext2
[2016-05-23 12:40:45 -0500] [Akram in #debian] s/where/were
[2016-05-23 12:40:46 -0500] [cmhobbs in #debian-offtopic] i haven't
[2016-05-23 12:40:48 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] sorry i am not very good at that but maybe you can just boot off usb and from there backup all files?
[2016-05-23 12:40:55 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] a live usb?
[2016-05-23 12:41:03 -0500] [Akram in #debian] markus_: the server is in the cloud
[2016-05-23 12:41:21 -0500] [Akram in #debian] markus_: I was abled to boot Rescue System, and chroot, and update grub
[2016-05-23 12:41:38 -0500] [Akram in #debian] but with no success, boot returns to the grub shell
[2016-05-23 12:41:46 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and if I type: boot
[2016-05-23 12:41:55 -0500] [antzero in #debian] Is there a decent way to use Google Drive on Debian or should I switch to dropbox?
[2016-05-23 12:41:57 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] what cloud provider?
[2016-05-23 12:42:02 -0500] [Akram in #debian] I got: error: no loaded kernel
[2016-05-23 12:42:06 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] so this is your first pratchett book?
[2016-05-23 12:42:20 -0500] [Akram in #debian] markus_: it is a Physical server, hosted in France
[2016-05-23 12:42:53 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] Akram: sorry i think maybe i am not the right person. maybe somebody else here can help if i am quiet
[2016-05-23 12:43:03 -0500] [Akram in #debian] :D
[2016-05-23 12:43:06 -0500] [markus_ in #debian] :P
[2016-05-23 12:43:20 -0500] [Akram in #debian] let's wait for a while :D
[2016-05-23 12:43:31 -0500] [Akram in #debian] Keep Calm And Relax :D
[2016-05-23 12:43:32 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: ovh?
[2016-05-23 12:43:49 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: yes, but that does not make any difference :D
[2016-05-23 12:44:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: you mentioned it being a physical server, yet said it was in the cloud
[2016-05-23 12:44:11 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: is it a vps?
[2016-05-23 12:44:37 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] it's a dedicated server
[2016-05-23 12:44:57 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: dedicated :D but, really, it is not the issue :D
[2016-05-23 12:45:13 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: what do you want to do, restore the boot loader?
[2016-05-23 12:45:36 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: I tried already to restore it: chroot , grub-update
[2016-05-23 12:45:52 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: but it seems to not solve the issue: still not booting
[2016-05-23 12:46:14 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: I followed these steps which seem ok to me: http://askubuntu.com/questions/145241/how-do-i-run-update-grub-from-a-livecd
[2016-05-23 12:46:32 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: if I were you i'd probably boot into rescue mode and then pigz up the important data and sftp.. or i'd make an image of the whole device instead
[2016-05-23 12:46:52 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: and then losetup it on the localhost to extract the data
[2016-05-23 12:47:05 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: was this a partitioned system - /boot was dedicated?
[2016-05-23 12:47:21 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: it is partitioned indeed
[2016-05-23 12:47:39 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: KVM?
[2016-05-23 12:47:43 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] ^
[2016-05-23 12:47:50 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: it was debian 6, I upgraded to 7, and everything was ok
[2016-05-23 12:48:10 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and then upgraded to 8, and now, grub just give me the grub shell
[2016-05-23 12:48:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: how are you identifying that
[2016-05-23 12:48:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: via KVM?
[2016-05-23 12:48:29 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] Akram: If it's a cloud instance, just get a fresh image and move the data over. No point in putting work into a system that's not trustworthy anymore.
[2016-05-23 12:48:36 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: no, dedicated, physical, it is a dell, I have IDRAC (console)
[2016-05-23 12:48:53 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: ok, so you got kvm.. guess it's not the kimsufi line :D
[2016-05-23 12:49:29 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: i'd grub-install over
[2016-05-23 12:49:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: how do you do this ?
[2016-05-23 12:50:21 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: run grub-install
[2016-05-23 12:50:24 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Akram: same as update-grub, except run grub-install /dev/sda or wherever
[2016-05-23 12:50:46 -0500] [Akram in #debian] jelly: telecity: I will give it a try right now
[2016-05-23 12:50:57 -0500] [telecity in #debian] inb4 fubar
[2016-05-23 12:51:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] the good thing is you got KVM
[2016-05-23 12:52:07 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: jelly: what should e the install device ? the one containing /boot or the one containing / ?
[2016-05-23 12:52:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] rootfs and /boot on a diff device?
[2016-05-23 12:52:27 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: yes
[2016-05-23 12:52:45 -0500] [telecity in #debian] GPT?
[2016-05-23 12:52:50 -0500] [Akram in #debian] root is :  / => /dev/sda2
[2016-05-23 12:53:00 -0500] [Akram in #debian] boot is : /boot => /dev/sda1
[2016-05-23 12:53:12 -0500] [telecity in #debian] that's the same device
[2016-05-23 12:53:26 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: oh sorry
[2016-05-23 12:53:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] what about the partition table - is it GPT or DOS (MBR)
[2016-05-23 12:53:45 -0500] [Akram in #debian] oh by the way, I restarted in rescue and watched the fs
[2016-05-23 12:53:56 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you did what
[2016-05-23 12:54:00 -0500] [Akram in #debian] here it is /dev/sda1 on /boot type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
[2016-05-23 12:54:33 -0500] [telecity in #debian] parted /dev/sda
[2016-05-23 12:54:34 -0500] [telecity in #debian] u s
[2016-05-23 12:54:34 -0500] [telecity in #debian] p
[2016-05-23 12:54:50 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and when I was doint root (hd0.1) , grub was telling it was ext2
[2016-05-23 12:54:58 -0500] [Akram in #debian] now it is ext4 apparently
[2016-05-23 12:55:02 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Akram: you should install grub to /dev/sda not /sda1 or /dev/sda2
[2016-05-23 12:55:21 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Akram: boot is generally ext2
[2016-05-23 12:55:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] there has to be a valid boot sector
[2016-05-23 12:55:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian]  grub-install /dev/sda
[2016-05-23 12:55:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian] Installing for i386-pc platform.
[2016-05-23 12:55:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian] Installation finished. No error reported.
[2016-05-23 12:55:45 -0500] [petn-randall in #debian] Akram: Are you booting via UEFI or via legacy BIOS?
[2016-05-23 12:56:13 -0500] [Akram in #debian] petn-randall: I think it is legacy, but how can I deternmine it? dmesg ?
[2016-05-23 12:56:16 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hell petn-randall already gave you the best advice.
[2016-05-23 12:56:18 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] petn-randall: well it seems to be MBR or at least grub thinks so :P
[2016-05-23 12:57:04 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Akram: you should know if _your_ server does EFI or MBR ...
[2016-05-23 12:57:34 -0500] [Akram in #debian] teraflops: just saying in introduction: I am helping a friend, who has the server for a long time
[2016-05-23 12:58:06 -0500] [telecity in #debian] and #debian is helping you
[2016-05-23 12:58:14 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] s/you/your friend
[2016-05-23 12:58:19 -0500] [Akram in #debian] teraflops: someone ordered it, and set it up 3 years ago, and now I have the baby
[2016-05-23 12:58:32 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: v important information :D
[2016-05-23 12:58:49 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: :)
[2016-05-23 12:59:15 -0500] [Akram in #debian] just like we say, the friends of my friends are my friends :D
[2016-05-23 12:59:25 -0500] [telecity in #debian] i think you can determine this through 'dmidecode'
[2016-05-23 12:59:29 -0500] [telecity in #debian] whether EFI or BIOS
[2016-05-23 12:59:36 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] or just reboot :P
[2016-05-23 13:00:23 -0500] [Akram in #debian] dmidecode  | grep -i efi , returns nothing

[2016-05-23 13:00:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian]         Release Date: 10/18/2010
[2016-05-23 13:00:49 -0500] [Akram in #debian] looks like legacy enough :D
[2016-05-23 13:00:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Akram: run as sudo and don't paste
[2016-05-23 13:01:06 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Akram: just make sure the grub config has been updated
[2016-05-23 13:02:17 -0500] [Akram in #debian] -r--r--r-- 1 root root 9479 May 23 19:26 /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[2016-05-23 13:02:34 -0500] [Akram in #debian] looks like, the update-grub updated it, but the install did not
[2016-05-23 13:02:42 -0500] [Akram in #debian] is it expected ?
[2016-05-23 13:02:54 -0500] [telecity in #debian] just reboot
[2016-05-23 13:03:09 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you got rescue mode and console, you'd be ok
[2016-05-23 13:03:13 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: ok, let's go for it
[2016-05-23 13:03:36 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: nothing more ? since reboot takes time, don't want to take it :D
[2016-05-23 13:03:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you even have ovh technicians.. although the support is non-existant
[2016-05-23 13:04:18 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: yea just reboot
[2016-05-23 13:04:27 -0500] [daily in #debian] telecity: I know that all too well.
[2016-05-23 13:04:37 -0500] [daily in #debian] 2 weeks to get a problem resolved, that was THEIR fault.
[2016-05-23 13:04:38 -0500] [telecity in #debian] most likely the config is fluffed up anyway, but deal with that later
[2016-05-23 13:04:43 -0500] [telecity in #debian] daily: idd
[2016-05-23 13:04:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian] what good would a technician do that remote console and reboot button does not do
[2016-05-23 13:04:50 -0500] [Akram in #debian] ok, gone for reboot
[2016-05-23 13:04:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] why do you stay? my vps supplier has great support
[2016-05-23 13:05:07 -0500] [telecity in #debian] markybob: ovh is cheap
[2016-05-23 13:05:21 -0500] [telecity in #debian] markybob: good network throughput, latency
[2016-05-23 13:05:43 -0500] [telecity in #debian] markybob: and good hardware specs
[2016-05-23 13:06:00 -0500] [telecity in #debian] markybob: even API
[2016-05-23 13:06:03 -0500] [daily in #debian] They're coming out with US locations soon too.
[2016-05-23 13:06:19 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] telecity: latency depends on the endpoint. I bet you get shitty latency from India
[2016-05-23 13:06:19 -0500] [daily in #debian] If you're looking for a lowend provider, check out #lowendbox. Community based around it.
[2016-05-23 13:06:22 -0500] [Akram in #debian] anyway thank you guys :) still don't know if it will be working :)
[2016-05-23 13:06:38 -0500] [telecity in #debian] teraflops: ofcourse it does, i'm talking about proper peering/transit with the major IXs
[2016-05-23 13:06:49 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: so why the grub-install may have not been done by the apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[2016-05-23 13:07:11 -0500] [Akram in #debian] youhou !!!!! thank you guys
[2016-05-23 13:07:15 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] :P
[2016-05-23 13:07:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] it worked?
[2016-05-23 13:07:44 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: yes it worked, thanks
[2016-05-23 13:08:00 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: you're welcome.. thank god we didn't have to look/debug your grub config
[2016-05-23 13:08:14 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: and maybe grub overwrote the sploit you had at sector 0
[2016-05-23 13:08:17 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: :D indeed, thank God :D

[2016-05-23 13:08:41 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: I was quite confident about that, but I am still missing the grub-install
[2016-05-23 13:08:51 -0500] [Akram in #debian] telecity: I will look for an explaination
[2016-05-23 13:08:51 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: how did the perp get access?
[2016-05-23 13:09:04 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: which exploit
[2016-05-23 13:09:06 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops: te piso los pies ;)
[2016-05-23 13:09:28 -0500] [Akram in #debian] oh, I don't know for sure now, but
[2016-05-23 13:10:02 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] eh
[2016-05-23 13:10:03 -0500] [Akram in #debian] at the website root, there were an SQL script, belonging to root and on 777
[2016-05-23 13:10:15 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and, what we had know
[2016-05-23 13:10:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] well that's stupid as fuck
[2016-05-23 13:10:36 -0500] [Akram in #debian] sorry, what he got, it is a small book store,
[2016-05-23 13:10:38 -0500] [markybob in #debian] do what petn-randall told you to do right now
[2016-05-23 13:10:49 -0500] [Akram in #debian] he lost almost all orders since 2013
[2016-05-23 13:10:54 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] ah
[2016-05-23 13:10:56 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] ;P
[2016-05-23 13:11:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: what's the point of bringing this server online atm?
[2016-05-23 13:11:12 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Akram: do those people not have backups?
[2016-05-23 13:11:17 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and the SQL script was containing data drop an recreated the DB with data of 2013
[2016-05-23 13:11:33 -0500] [Akram in #debian] jelly: I found the backup fortunately

[2016-05-23 13:11:55 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Akram: it's obviously compromised, apt-get install chkrootkit at least
[2016-05-23 13:12:18 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and then, I said, let's get for an update at least, to take some time to breathe
[2016-05-23 13:12:28 -0500] [Akram in #debian] and in the middle :) I broke it

[2016-05-23 13:12:47 -0500] [Akram in #debian] so, let's keep it working back a little, and start another one
[2016-05-23 13:12:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] as in "compromised" by disgrunted ex-admin whose access was never revoked?

[2016-05-23 13:16:59 -0500] [telecity in #debian] say you're a hacker, you gain access.. can you change ALL timestamps of some file on an ext4 to make it pose as something that hasn't been touched/changed?
[2016-05-23 13:17:14 -0500] [martman in #debian] im having problems installing a powerpc build system and im not sure what docs to use. looks emdebian is dead and the other multilib stuff isnt going the greatest for me. i cant find any powerpc packages after editing my sources file and adding the arch ti dpkg

[2016-05-23 14:11:01 -0500] [Exagone313 in #debian] Hi, I can't install netfilter/iptables-persistent, the installation fails, here is journalctl -xn content: http://dpaste.com/0VM5PGV I had this problem on another computer and I ended up to create a startup script instead of using that.. I thought it would be fixed later. What can I do? Thanks for your help.
[2016-05-23 14:14:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Exagone313: looks like you're not using a jessie kernel. the packages probably work without grsecurity
[2016-05-23 14:17:07 -0500] [Exagone313 in #debian] yes, OVH uses a custom kernel, I don't know why :s
[2016-05-23 14:17:44 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Exagone313: part of the suite that involves isntalling spyware :p
[2016-05-23 14:18:10 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Exagone313: they install monitoring daemon afair
[2016-05-23 14:18:17 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Exagone313: out of curiosity, wasn't OVH KVM?
[2016-05-23 14:18:29 -0500] [Exagone313 in #debian] it's a dedicated server
[2016-05-23 14:18:40 -0500] [Exagone313 in #debian] I don't know what you're asking
[2016-05-23 14:18:50 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] well that's even worst :P
[2016-05-23 14:18:54 -0500] [telecity in #debian] im not sure you need a custom kernel for monitoring daemons
[2016-05-23 14:20:00 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] hello guys
[2016-05-23 14:20:03 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] What package has the character map, or whatever it's called, to let me select the hard-to-remember-how-to-type semi-unusual unicode character that I want?
[2016-05-23 14:20:39 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Depends on *how* unusual.
[2016-05-23 14:20:57 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] I said "semi-unusual" :P
[2016-05-23 14:20:59 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Some can be typed with Multi_key but most can't.
[2016-05-23 14:21:16 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] I thought everything could be typed if you know the code for it.
[2016-05-23 14:21:23 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] (I rent a server at ovh and they told me I was doing some attack on a specific IP ... (I absolutely don't but .. if they say it it is probably the case :D ) Is there a way to find what service on my debian send to what ip something ? thank you in advance for your advices)
[2016-05-23 14:21:24 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Your locale setting also affects what you can do with Multi_key.
[2016-05-23 14:21:47 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] anyways, I'm trying to find the graphical program, that has a list of "all" the unicode characters.
[2016-05-23 14:21:54 -0500] [mutante in #debian] sees WormFood build his own unicode-characters-semi
[2016-05-23 14:22:08 -0500] [greycat in #debian] WormFood: I believe that's called "iceweasel".  You go to a wikipedia page that has a list of the chars.
[2016-05-23 14:22:34 -0500] [mutante in #debian] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters
[2016-05-23 14:22:34 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] greycat, I'm well aware of that. That isn't what I'm looking for.
[2016-05-23 14:23:13 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] seriously guys. That is exactly what I didn't ask for.
[2016-05-23 14:23:17 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: lsof, netstat, ps, iptables with logging
[2016-05-23 14:23:19 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] WormFood: use a font inspector or whatever it's called. as in gnome font viewer
[2016-05-23 14:23:24 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Well, clearly nobody here knows what you are asking for.
[2016-05-23 14:23:38 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] no teraflops. There is an applet for this.
[2016-05-23 14:23:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If you'd just say WHAT CHARACTER and LOCALE you want, we might be able to tell you how to type it.
[2016-05-23 14:23:47 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] I just don't know what package it's part of.
[2016-05-23 14:23:55 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] oh an applet ...
[2016-05-23 14:24:17 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] it's probably something named *-apps
[2016-05-23 14:24:29 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity: ps doesn't give any info related to packets ...
[2016-05-23 14:24:57 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: it gives info related to running processes
[2016-05-23 14:25:19 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] yes that I agree with but.. you mean I have to "mix all of them" ?
[2016-05-23 14:25:22 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: and something from that list.. is sending.. pkts
[2016-05-23 14:25:24 -0500] [blackbit in #debian] is Evgeni Golov or Antonio Terceiro here? or anybody else who works with lxc?
[2016-05-23 14:25:44 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] if you use vte terminal you can use pangoview for doing the opposite as in identify what font family renders a given glyph
[2016-05-23 14:26:59 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: no, just monitor active connections, sort per process.. then either tcpdump or use iptables logging
[2016-05-23 14:27:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: if it's sending out "attacks", then it's an outgoing connection.. likely TCP or UDP, but can be ICMP or whatever other protocol..
[2016-05-23 14:27:55 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] The package is "gucharmap", to answer my own question.
[2016-05-23 14:28:10 -0500] [greycat in #debian] ,info gucharmap
[2016-05-23 14:28:11 -0500] [judd in #debian] Package gucharmap (gnome, optional) in jessie/amd64: Unicode character picker and font browser. Version: 1:3.14.1-1; Size: 649.0k; Installed: 4009k; Homepage: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gucharmap; Screenshot: http://screenshots.debian.net/package/gucharmap
[2016-05-23 14:28:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: i'd first inspect for any suspicious processes
[2016-05-23 14:29:00 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: then try to identify from active connections
[2016-05-23 14:29:10 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: then resort to packet logging / dumping
[2016-05-23 14:29:12 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity: right yes I use docker so on the main it should be nothing special is there any "list of normal process" ?
[2016-05-23 14:29:21 -0500] [telecity in #debian] docker
[2016-05-23 14:29:25 -0500] [telecity in #debian] omg
[2016-05-23 14:29:48 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: can you just make a new container then
[2016-05-23 14:29:55 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: and disregard the old one
[2016-05-23 14:29:57 -0500] [WormFood in #debian] ΩΩΩ :D
[2016-05-23 14:30:19 -0500] [telecity in #debian] WormFood: looks like an omega in my irssi
[2016-05-23 14:30:19 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity: the attack come from the docker host machine
[2016-05-23 14:30:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: oh ok
[2016-05-23 14:30:40 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: lots of containers, different users?
[2016-05-23 14:30:48 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: you're hosting docker, not using it yourself?
[2016-05-23 14:31:00 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] I host it and use it
[2016-05-23 14:31:12 -0500] [telecity in #debian] and anyone else?
[2016-05-23 14:31:14 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] 20 containers
[2016-05-23 14:31:15 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] noone
[2016-05-23 14:31:34 -0500] [telecity in #debian] just tell ovh
[2016-05-23 14:31:36 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you fixed it
[2016-05-23 14:31:45 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] but I have to say I didnt really secured my server for now...
[2016-05-23 14:31:55 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] so I will do it now xD
[2016-05-23 14:32:03 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] yes for now I did this
[2016-05-23 14:32:07 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] so they reenable my ip
[2016-05-23 14:32:09 -0500] [telecity in #debian] why do u need docker?
[2016-05-23 14:32:20 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] but I have to find the mistake otherwise it will come again xD
[2016-05-23 14:32:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] next time you might get perm disabled
[2016-05-23 14:32:34 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] because it's suit my needs
[2016-05-23 14:32:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] what do you do with it?
[2016-05-23 14:33:08 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] ldap, jira, confluence, jenkins, 5 websites, and some other stuff
[2016-05-23 14:33:10 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] multiple db
[2016-05-23 14:33:18 -0500] [telecity in #debian] i see
[2016-05-23 14:33:26 -0500] [telecity in #debian] could've deployed all that on the same server though
[2016-05-23 14:33:43 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] yes but well I create docker image for my website now ^^
[2016-05-23 14:33:50 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] so I wont change to go back
[2016-05-23 14:33:50 -0500] [telecity in #debian] good luck
[2016-05-23 14:33:50 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] :D
[2016-05-23 14:33:56 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] I already do it
[2016-05-23 14:34:14 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] well I have to deal with my server for now
[2016-05-23 14:34:27 -0500] [telecity in #debian] i found docker to be very confusing
[2016-05-23 14:34:28 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] I will try to do some netstats as you said thx
[2016-05-23 14:34:59 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: netstat only handles udp and tcp
[2016-05-23 14:35:12 -0500] [telecity in #debian] and unix sockets
[2016-05-23 14:35:41 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity: docker is another philosophy some likes some not yep ;) But I really like the "you did something wrong ?" -> remove your container your os is still clean xD
[2016-05-23 14:36:31 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: right. exactly. really seemed like one big wrapper and over-simplification of something a poweruser usually does
[2016-05-23 14:36:48 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] 106.185.47.251:80 TCP SYN 40 ATTACK:TCP_SYN
[2016-05-23 14:37:10 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] so it is TCP
[2016-05-23 14:37:18 -0500] [telecity in #debian] where's this line from
[2016-05-23 14:37:28 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] the "log attack" from ovh
[2016-05-23 14:37:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] i dont think ovh would report a tcp syn.. tcp syn is pretty meh
[2016-05-23 14:37:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] oh
[2016-05-23 14:37:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] ok
[2016-05-23 14:37:45 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] I have 25 times this line xD
[2016-05-23 14:37:51 -0500] [telecity in #debian] 25 times where
[2016-05-23 14:38:01 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] on the log trace
[2016-05-23 14:38:09 -0500] [telecity in #debian] the one they gave u?
[2016-05-23 14:38:31 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] yep
[2016-05-23 14:38:46 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you're lucky they spoke to you
[2016-05-23 14:38:54 -0500] [telecity in #debian] usually they are like IDGAF just fix it
[2016-05-23 14:39:22 -0500] [telecity in #debian] when you RFC they just "fix it or be perm disabled"
[2016-05-23 14:39:29 -0500] [telecity in #debian] ok well
[2016-05-23 14:39:39 -0500] [sypher in #debian] ovh is the worst garbage provider I've ever seen.
[2016-05-23 14:39:46 -0500] [sypher in #debian] but that's probably not helpful.
[2016-05-23 14:39:48 -0500] [telecity in #debian] in terms of support - yes
[2016-05-23 14:39:57 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] support ? if you pay maybe...
[2016-05-23 14:39:58 -0500] [sypher in #debian] in terms of infrastructure, too.
[2016-05-23 14:40:04 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] "your offer doesnt allow support"
[2016-05-23 14:40:05 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] :D
[2016-05-23 14:40:24 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] sbeex: :P
[2016-05-23 14:40:25 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sypher: dunno, my experience in terms of infrastruture has been pretty poisitive thus far
[2016-05-23 14:40:41 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] but well.. where should I start my investigate ?
[2016-05-23 14:40:43 -0500] [sypher in #debian] telecity: Then you'd be the first I've ever spoken to.
[2016-05-23 14:41:06 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] configure the firewall with iptable could solve that right ? can I make a rule to say -> all going to -> ip (from the log) -> reject
[2016-05-23 14:41:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: look at iptables -j LOG --log-prefix="MYLOG: " .. OUTPUT chain
[2016-05-23 14:41:18 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] my iptables is empty for now :D
[2016-05-23 14:41:22 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] i didnt do anything
[2016-05-23 14:41:40 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] Im ready an howto since 10 minutes
[2016-05-23 14:41:53 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: you can log all pkts with SYN flags to port 80
[2016-05-23 14:42:01 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: but if you even do a system update it will be there
[2016-05-23 14:42:18 -0500] [telecity in #debian] the TCP syn is probably bullshit
[2016-05-23 14:42:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] anyway
[2016-05-23 14:42:32 -0500] [telecity in #debian] probably just a false positive somehow

[2016-05-23 14:43:22 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] Souchiro: dichosos los ojos que te leen :P
[2016-05-23 14:43:33 -0500] [sypher in #debian] telecity: probably off-topic at this point, honestly.

[2016-05-23 14:48:11 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] holding my breath for when 4K becomes common

[2016-05-23 15:02:55 -0500] [awwal in #debian] telecity, teraflops, thats my config file. if you have time and interest you may where to look or what can be done for top layer http://paste.debian.net/697623
[2016-05-23 15:03:16 -0500] [awwal in #debian] you may know/find ... ^
[2016-05-23 15:04:37 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] please help me with this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f94eb14ae84b664123f2400caa3995c4
[2016-05-23 15:04:42 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] before i lock myself out
[2016-05-23 15:05:57 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] awwal: what's your setup? Just openbox + xmobar?
[2016-05-23 15:07:00 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, i have xfce but i usually use openbox; I run xmobar when in openbox session yeah
[2016-05-23 15:07:34 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Then I guess is openbox related not xmobar related
[2016-05-23 15:09:28 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Heh I do xmonad but I don't do xmobar
[2016-05-23 15:11:21 -0500] [MachinaeWolf in #debian] Ok if you ran a debootstrap of sid what do you do to chroot into it after?
[2016-05-23 15:12:05 -0500] [greycat in #debian] chroot /path/to/your/sid
[2016-05-23 15:13:41 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] buenas muyayos :-)
[2016-05-23 15:14:56 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] !give tout saludo
[2016-05-23 15:14:57 -0500] [orome in #debian-es-offtopic] tout: hola muyayo!
[2016-05-23 15:15:02 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] ffs
[2016-05-23 15:15:04 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] can anyone help
[2016-05-23 15:15:15 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] my sshd_config change (adding a user to allowed users) isn't working
[2016-05-23 15:15:22 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, I did a heavy search and it's complicated. seems that it's haskell language programing related and seems that xmobar just doesnt support top layer and autohide
[2016-05-23 15:15:22 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] can't login as them, as if the change is ignored
[2016-05-23 15:15:26 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Did you restart ssh?
[2016-05-23 15:15:28 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] yes
[2016-05-23 15:15:32 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] sudo service restart sshd
[2016-05-23 15:15:40 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] i also stopped it
[2016-05-23 15:15:41 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] and started
[2016-05-23 15:15:43 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] i also reloaded
[2016-05-23 15:15:44 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] :-)
[2016-05-23 15:15:54 -0500] [greycat in #debian] That is not the service name on Debian.  It's ssh, not sshd.
[2016-05-23 15:16:36 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] did that but still can't login
[2016-05-23 15:16:46 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] awwal: in xmonad you have to specify you're using xmobar in the xmonad.hs file so they work fine together
[2016-05-23 15:17:03 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] ssh/sshd are the same on my system anyway
[2016-05-23 15:17:07 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] for service
[2016-05-23 15:17:13 -0500] [greycat in #debian] What did you put for AllowUsers
[2016-05-23 15:17:17 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity:  what do you think about this line on my firewall file (iptable) iptables -A OUTPUT -s 106.185.47.251 -j DROP
[2016-05-23 15:17:27 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] will it disallow all trafic on this ip ?
[2016-05-23 15:17:38 -0500] [LtL in #debian] Neobenedict_: is the user in /etc/passwd with a shell ?
[2016-05-23 15:17:47 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] *outgoing
[2016-05-23 15:17:48 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] awwal: No idea about openbox but it looks.like it doesn't know there is a bar there
[2016-05-23 15:17:56 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] i can su user
[2016-05-23 15:17:59 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] with a password
[2016-05-23 15:18:01 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] so i assume so yes
[2016-05-23 15:18:02 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, I believe that xmobar integrates better with xmonad being created for it.
[2016-05-23 15:18:24 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] and AllowUsers a b c d user1 (not posting the actual users)
[2016-05-23 15:18:28 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] maybe the number is an issue? idk
[2016-05-23 15:18:41 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, no clue about thats (openbox doesn't know its there)
[2016-05-23 15:19:17 -0500] [LtL in #debian] Neobenedict_: tail -f /var/log/auth.log while attempting to login, look
[2016-05-23 15:19:20 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] guys
[2016-05-23 15:19:23 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] if I sudo service sshd stop
[2016-05-23 15:19:27 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] should I be able to log in
[2016-05-23 15:19:33 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] with a new shell
[2016-05-23 15:19:51 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, btw,  in haskell language -- is for comment, eh?
[2016-05-23 15:19:52 -0500] [greycat in #debian] I don't even think he's a Debian user.
[2016-05-23 15:19:54 -0500] [LtL in #debian] Neobenedict_: no
[2016-05-23 15:20:07 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] awwal: yep
[2016-05-23 15:20:14 -0500] [awwal in #debian] teraflops, ok
[2016-05-23 15:20:28 -0500] [awwal in #debian] just wanted to be sure about it :P
[2016-05-23 15:20:30 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] i think somehow i have two ssh processes running
[2016-05-23 15:20:32 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] is there a way to check
[2016-05-23 15:20:49 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] nothing about failed logins in auth.log
[2016-05-23 15:21:28 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] root      1912  0.0  0.0  55168  3084 ?        Ss   22:15   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D

[2016-05-23 15:21:46 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Be careful The combo is.comming
[2016-05-23 15:22:09 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] kill the 24776 process?
[2016-05-23 15:22:30 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Now you're just typing random shit.
[2016-05-23 15:22:58 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] are you trying to help or make unfunny comments greycat
[2016-05-23 15:23:07 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You've given no evidence that you're using Debian, or that you are connecting to the right server, or that you are using the correct username, or the correct syntax in the file, or ANYTHING.
[2016-05-23 15:23:18 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] the evidence i'm using debian is I joined #debian
[2016-05-23 15:23:33 -0500] [greycat in #debian] 16:23 Ignoring ALL from Neobenedict_
[2016-05-23 15:23:36 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] good
[2016-05-23 15:23:38 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] fuck off
[2016-05-23 15:23:43 -0500] [Neobenedict_ in #debian] now, I have two sshd processes running according to this, one with -D
[2016-05-23 15:24:01 -0500] [mutante in #debian] well, now i'm not gonna help
[2016-05-23 15:24:06 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] frangor: jajaja

[2016-05-23 15:43:18 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over a network.

[2016-05-23 15:43:31 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] jak2000: putting ftp.us.debian.org in /etc/hosts could very well cause future pain.. are you able to resolve any DNS at all?
[2016-05-23 15:43:33 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] jak2000: See Above
[2016-05-23 15:43:55 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity but I can DROP and LOG on the same line or do I have to do a new one ?
[2016-05-23 15:43:57 -0500] [FinalX in #debian] heh, ntp with the debian pool, I remember our department submitting a nasty thing with that :)

[2016-05-23 15:47:13 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: (was a joke)
[2016-05-23 15:47:58 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: i'll nmap scan it for you.. not sure what for though
[2016-05-23 15:48:23 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity ok.. I have a joke that is not really one for me :D --> I configured iptables and now nothing works on my containers haha
[2016-05-23 15:48:40 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] I am going to spend a good night :D
[2016-05-23 15:48:47 -0500] [telecity in #debian] you what
[2016-05-23 15:49:08 -0500] [telecity in #debian] ok do a "iptables -S"
[2016-05-23 15:49:23 -0500] [telecity in #debian] got ufw too?
[2016-05-23 15:49:45 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] ufw ?
[2016-05-23 15:50:02 -0500] [telecity in #debian] "ufw status"
[2016-05-23 15:50:15 -0500] [telecity in #debian] anyway just "iptables -S" and use a pastie
[2016-05-23 15:50:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: i'm 99% sure we're doing something that's not even needed cause of false positive to that crappy host

[2016-05-23 15:51:04 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity it's possible :)
[2016-05-23 15:51:28 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] but now my shipyard can't be reached on 8080 well it works only at the fresh reboot and then end..
[2016-05-23 15:51:37 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: why do you have a DROP policy by default
[2016-05-23 15:51:44 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: most likely ufw is indeed enabled
[2016-05-23 15:51:54 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] what is UFW ? :D
[2016-05-23 15:52:02 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: what does ufw status
[2016-05-23 15:52:03 -0500] [telecity in #debian] say?
[2016-05-23 15:52:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !ufw
[2016-05-23 15:52:08 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Uncomplicated firewall (ufw) is an <iptables> front-end with syntax similar to OpenBSD's Packet Filter (PF).  https://launchpad.net/ufw
[2016-05-23 15:52:12 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] command not found
[2016-05-23 15:52:15 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it's firewall for dummies
[2016-05-23 15:52:31 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] should I install it?
[2016-05-23 15:52:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i wouldn't
[2016-05-23 15:52:56 -0500] [greycat in #debian] iptables is complicated enough without adding an emulation-of-OpenBSD layer on top of it
[2016-05-23 15:53:04 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: you have a DROP policy by default atm, anything that isn't whitelisted = will be blocked
[2016-05-23 15:53:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] if you need firewall help you should ask the experts in #netfilter
[2016-05-23 15:53:21 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] telecity and it is good I think. So I have to allow everything I want
[2016-05-23 15:53:30 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: it's good if you know what you're doing
[2016-05-23 15:53:39 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: doesn't sound like you do so far :D
[2016-05-23 15:53:48 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] pfff :p
[2016-05-23 15:54:20 -0500] [telecity in #debian] sbeex: so your docker bloat isn't working atm, right?
[2016-05-23 15:54:49 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] vale, acabo de ver el error

[2016-05-23 15:58:19 -0500] [mutante in #debian] if you accept everything why have a packet filter
[2016-05-23 15:58:29 -0500] [telecity in #debian] so you can block what you don't want to accept
[2016-05-23 15:58:37 -0500] [telecity in #debian] we're talking about the default policy
[2016-05-23 15:58:47 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] well now it works again
[2016-05-23 15:58:59 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] so I can later uncomment and find the right ports to open ;)
[2016-05-23 15:59:00 -0500] [sbeex in #debian] thank you

[2016-05-23 16:02:29 -0500] [Kiril in #debian] hello, guys
[2016-05-23 16:02:59 -0500] [Kiril in #debian] could you tell me how to list all available daemons runned ?
[2016-05-23 16:03:27 -0500] [greycat in #debian] systemctl -a, or ps auxw
[2016-05-23 16:03:42 -0500] [Kiril in #debian] also how to disable some of them like ; alsa-utils , bluetooth and etc
[2016-05-23 16:03:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian] alsa-utils is not a daemon
[2016-05-23 16:04:12 -0500] [Aorious in #debian] Hi, I have a startup script in the autostart folder, to setup some xmodmap keybinds. How these be made persist through Gnome restarts (some times Gnome freezes so I need to restart it)?
[2016-05-23 16:05:19 -0500] [telecity in #debian] Kiril: lsmod, modprobe, depmod.. research that
[2016-05-23 16:05:40 -0500] [greycat in #debian] That has nothing to do with daemons either.
[2016-05-23 16:06:06 -0500] [telecity in #debian] greycat: indeed, but prety sure he meant modules, right?
[2016-05-23 16:06:30 -0500] [greycat in #debian] God only knows, since he gave two examples that had nothing in common with each other, or with daemons in general.
[2016-05-23 16:06:47 -0500] [telecity in #debian] greycat: true.. although i still suspect modules due to alsa
[2016-05-23 16:07:04 -0500] [greycat in #debian] if the real question is "How to disable support for my hardware", rmmod isn't the answer either.  Though I don't have a clue why he wants to disable support for his hardware.
[2016-05-23 16:07:41 -0500] [telecity in #debian] greycat: most likely just wants to prevent some specific modules loading on startup
[2016-05-23 16:08:00 -0500] [greycat in #debian] In which case the answer is module blacklisting.

[2016-05-23 16:25:45 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] why does the systemd implementation suck so hard? its a NP hard problem to restart a service now
[2016-05-23 16:25:53 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] whispering a prayer es muy buena y es guitarra pelada :)

[2016-05-23 16:26:39 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aubergine: it's really easy to restart a daemon. seriously?
[2016-05-23 16:26:42 -0500] [telecity in #debian] does systemd still use sysvinit rc scripts as backend?
[2016-05-23 16:26:46 -0500] [telecity in #debian] or only sync
[2016-05-23 16:26:47 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] lo oigo bien, pero me saturo 
[2016-05-23 16:26:59 -0500] [telecity in #debian] the init itself changed so old init has no effect right?
[2016-05-23 16:27:05 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] a mi me pasa al contrario , escucho un poco de progresivo, me aburre y paso al metal

[2016-05-23 16:28:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aubergine: this is hard? sudo systemctl restart foo
[2016-05-23 16:28:35 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] markybob: lets use samba and apache2 as example. it's always a jeopardy if you have to use systemctl, the init script or the serivce binary
[2016-05-23 16:28:51 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] teraflops: tu eres betico
[2016-05-23 16:28:57 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] try sudo systemctl restart samba
[2016-05-23 16:29:19 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i dont use samba. i don't touch windows ever
[2016-05-23 16:29:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no problem with apache
[2016-05-23 16:29:38 -0500] [telecity in #debian] considering that SMB is CIFS
[2016-05-23 16:29:51 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] it would tell you that it doesn't restart
[2016-05-23 16:30:03 -0500] [telecity in #debian] aubergine: "service binary" - some ctl binary?
[2016-05-23 16:30:19 -0500] [xenial in #debian-es-offtopic] Teraflops, coml va debian?
[2016-05-23 16:30:23 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] service samba restart
[2016-05-23 16:30:44 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] aubergine: because samba is not the service ...
[2016-05-23 16:31:04 -0500] [telecity in #debian] aubergine: wouldn't that do the same thing as systemctl, if systemd is the init?
[2016-05-23 16:31:20 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] it should but it doesn't
[2016-05-23 16:31:41 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] aubergine: smbd.service and nmdb.service btw
[2016-05-23 16:31:56 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] tout: posi
[2016-05-23 16:31:58 -0500] [telecity in #debian] can you paste the output of both when triggered just for reference

[2016-05-23 16:32:26 -0500] [aubergine in #debian] yes and this sucks because in init.d and service its still samba like the 20 years before.

[2016-05-23 16:32:47 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] aubergine: THe native systemd stuff works pretty well, it's the init compatibility stuff that seems to break.

[2016-05-23 16:40:29 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] VulcanRidr, you can start by saying what the name of the app is./
[2016-05-23 16:40:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] VulcanRidr, tvtime is the name?

[2016-05-23 16:42:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] VulcanRidr, if anything is using pa, you can use "pacmd" and do "list-clients"
[2016-05-23 16:45:07 -0500] [VulcanRidr in #debian] jml2: No PulseAudio daemon running, or not running as session daemon.
[2016-05-23 16:45:38 -0500] [VulcanRidr in #debian] I think by default, it installs pa for local sessions only.
[2016-05-23 16:46:15 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] VulcanRidr: are you on tty? or no user logged in?
[2016-05-23 16:47:05 -0500] [VulcanRidr in #debian] teraflops: She's in an X session.

[2016-05-23 17:11:22 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] bueno me marcho, talues
[2016-05-23 17:12:12 -0500] [bob121212 in #debian] Hi, I have this gtk3 theme: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/OS+X+10.11+El+Capitan?content=174139 , I tried to extract it and copy it to /usr/share/themes , but its still not showing up in my themes list
[2016-05-23 17:12:40 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bob121212: you might need to log out and back in
[2016-05-23 17:13:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] but i don't use gtk3...so...i don't really know much on the topic
[2016-05-23 17:15:17 -0500] [bob121212_ in #debian] I tried to log in and out, but that did not work
[2016-05-23 17:15:40 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bob121212: did you restart all of x?  the WM?
[2016-05-23 17:17:52 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] bob121212_: can you see the theme via lxappearance or whatever you use to pick themes? (unless you use a plain settings.ini file)
[2016-05-23 17:18:25 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bob121212_: it's gnome?
[2016-05-23 17:19:57 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] bob121212_: btw did you read the instructions?
[2016-05-23 17:20:15 -0500] [bob121212_ in #debian] Yes I did
[2016-05-23 17:20:32 -0500] [bob121212_ in #debian] All of them just say to extract the zip file and move it to the themes folder

[2016-05-23 17:45:52 -0500] [gnumedia in #debian] Hello, which Debian channel do I need  to enquire within if I want to ask a specific libre software be added to repositories?
[2016-05-23 17:46:47 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] !rfp
[2016-05-23 17:46:47 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Request For Package (RFP) is the way to ask for a piece of software to be included in Debian.  See http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp, the section on that page "Adding new entries with "reportbug"" is a good place to start.  Technically, a RFP is a wishlist bug filed against "wnpp" with a title beginning "RFP: ", ask me about <wnpp>.  The best way of getting software packaged is to do it yourself: ask me about <nmg>.
[2016-05-23 17:47:19 -0500] [jrg in #debian] can someone help me out with: https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/problems-with-linux-os-x-windows-permissions.43586/#post-287797
[2016-05-23 17:47:38 -0500] [jrg in #debian] some files will rm .. some won't and i have no idea why. doesn't seem like a permissions issue
[2016-05-23 17:47:42 -0500] [jrg in #debian] something else is wrong
[2016-05-23 17:48:24 -0500] [gnumedia in #debian] Well, a package 'not being there' is not really a bug per se...
[2016-05-23 17:49:50 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] gnumedia: you file an RFP, it's a type of bug in the BTS
[2016-05-23 17:52:51 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I feel like my personality has been split... or cut...

[2016-05-23 17:54:22 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] SplitMeOwnNet?
[2016-05-23 18:06:35 -0500] [gnumedia in #debian] okay, thanks, filing that request via 'reportbug' was interesting. I hope I did it correctly enough...
[2016-05-23 18:32:56 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] What Debian equivelant package provides libEGL_nvidia.so* ? I am having a hard time finding it (arch liunx: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/nvidia-utils/files/), and it's needed for a program according to 'strace -eopen'
[2016-05-23 18:47:58 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ProfessorKaos64, I'm only guessing by the library name, but since it's about nvidia, it probably comes from the proprietary driver.
[2016-05-23 18:48:16 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] strange, I have 355 installed, wonder if it's with a newer driver
[2016-05-23 18:48:22 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] on debian jessie
[2016-05-23 18:48:26 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] o.O That is odd.
[2016-05-23 18:48:40 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I don't know what makes the link, even if that lib is symbolic
[2016-05-23 18:48:55 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] Maybe I need to install the driver again
[2016-05-23 18:50:48 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ProfessorKaos64, I just looked in Synaptic, and there's a 'libegl1-nvidia' package available. (Sid)
[2016-05-23 18:50:56 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] hi, how do you stop a command when Ctrl + C doesn't work? generally because of too much output
[2016-05-23 18:51:29 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] Twirl, in another terminal, you can send it SIGTERM or SIGKILL with `kill -15 <pid>` or `kill -9 <pid>`
[2016-05-23 18:51:48 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] no luck naptastic , strange
[2016-05-23 18:51:51 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] but SIGINT (ctrl+c) usually works after a while.
[2016-05-23 18:52:07 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I'd switch to a new TTY and kill that process
[2016-05-23 18:52:19 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ProfessorKaos64, that's really strange. I'm using Nouveau, so I may not be able to help you much more.
[2016-05-23 18:52:28 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] it's ok, I appreciate the responses regardless
[2016-05-23 18:52:37 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] OH
[2016-05-23 18:52:42 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] Do you have contrib and non-free enabled?
[2016-05-23 18:52:44 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I usuall go to packages.debian.org and search the contents list too
[2016-05-23 18:52:53 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] nothing shows up there
[2016-05-23 18:53:12 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] it's pretty annoying when you are in ssh
[2016-05-23 18:53:40 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ProfessorKaos64, https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/libegl1-mesa/filelist
[2016-05-23 18:53:41 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] i would have to make a new connection and see what command is misbehaving and send the signal
[2016-05-23 18:53:47 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] aw.... here we go https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=experimental&arch=any&searchon=contents&keywords=libEGL_nvidia.so.0
[2016-05-23 18:53:48 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] whoops, that's the wrong things
[2016-05-23 18:53:55 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] THERE WE GO. :)
[2016-05-23 18:53:56 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] there's an experimental pkg
[2016-05-23 18:53:59 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] hmmmm
[2016-05-23 18:54:17 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] never was an issue before this version of retroarch, perhaps requires this now for vulkan support or something
[2016-05-23 18:54:22 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] or wayland idk
[2016-05-23 18:54:43 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] Twirl, yep... it's just the nature of the beast. Making SIGINT always work immediately would require some pretty drastic changes to the OS, and probably hurt performance terribly.
[2016-05-23 18:55:12 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] yea, perhaps I can't upgrade retroarch for my repo
[2016-05-23 18:55:17 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I provide packages for Jessie and SteamOS
[2016-05-23 18:55:36 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I have an issue submitted to them, so perhaps there is a workaround
[2016-05-23 18:55:43 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] I doubt I can backport that
[2016-05-23 18:56:56 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] YES! naptastic got it! at least on SteamOS
[2016-05-23 18:57:09 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] Valve provides the package in their repo , libegl-nvidia0
[2016-05-23 18:57:12 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] naptastic: idc man, you can't justify having to wait 30 minutes for a process that is also rendering the whole terminal unusable because of too much output, i use tmux and have 4 panels or sometimes more and just one process that sends too much output and i can't do anything else, i would have to launch a new terminal connect to the server and so on, that affects my performance
[2016-05-23 18:57:13 -0500] [ProfessorKaos64 in #debian] perhaps they melded it in
[2016-05-23 18:59:08 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] Twirl, yeah, I feel your pain (as a formerly professional sysadmin and downtime post-mortem analyst) the only thing worse is when the console is scrolling with OOM messages about PHP processes...
[2016-05-23 19:01:20 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] well, someone should make a systemd call or w/e to fix that
[2016-05-23 19:02:16 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] A systemd call to fix PHP?
[2016-05-23 19:02:32 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] resists the temptation...
[2016-05-23 19:04:45 -0500] [Twirl in #debian] no, to be able to kill out of control stdout or processes blowing up your terminal buffer
[2016-05-23 19:08:08 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] so i am trying to insall jessie on my desktop. I am haing issues getting my NIC drivers installed. Its a realtek 8168, get a message asking for them on reovable media, unpack the realtek-all.deb on a usb and insert, no luck
[2016-05-23 19:09:59 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] I remember having to do that one time for an Intel PRO/100 card. I couldn't do the "removable media" thing though, because the hosts were blades, and the only connections were ethernet and serial. So I had to modify the installer...
[2016-05-23 19:10:02 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] ...never again...
[2016-05-23 19:10:06 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] never again.
[2016-05-23 19:14:22 -0500] [francium in #debian] I just installed a new system with a btrfs filesystem, seperate home and root. How should I backup my system? What do people use?

[2016-05-23 19:49:07 -0500] [trysten in #debian] I want to try to repair the partition table of a disk image
[2016-05-23 19:49:42 -0500] [trysten in #debian] without changing the disk image, and it's absolutely huge
[2016-05-23 19:49:47 -0500] [trysten in #debian] so i'd rather not make a copy
[2016-05-23 19:49:53 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] i have no idea then
[2016-05-23 19:50:05 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i was hoping i could remount that part of the file system
[2016-05-23 19:51:18 -0500] [shadows in #debian] no such thing (that I know of)
[2016-05-23 19:52:08 -0500] [shadows in #debian] trysten: msdos partition info will be the first 512 bytes
[2016-05-23 19:52:24 -0500] [shadows in #debian] it's different if it is a GUID partitioning or other partitioning
[2016-05-23 19:52:37 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: good point. i could just backup the relevant areas
[2016-05-23 19:52:49 -0500] [shadows in #debian] trysten: advise to backup all the data, though
[2016-05-23 19:53:03 -0500] [trysten in #debian] but there's got to be a solution here. i know there are entire systems built around the same concept
[2016-05-23 19:53:33 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i used to use computers that would "wipe" all changes to the disk at every reboot, but allowed nearly full access
[2016-05-23 19:53:43 -0500] [trysten in #debian] they just didn't change the original files
[2016-05-23 19:53:47 -0500] [shadows in #debian] not to belittle your intelligence here, I'm just speaking from experience having fouled things up badly more often than not, and with dozens (if not hundreds, I am sure) of attempts over the last 20 years
[2016-05-23 19:54:29 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: oh no.. absolutely.
[2016-05-23 19:54:31 -0500] [shadows in #debian] when it goes well, you're still betting that you are smarter than unknown data corruption and that's a bad bet
[2016-05-23 19:54:39 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i wouldn't risk it unless i knew
[2016-05-23 19:55:06 -0500] [trysten in #debian] no the storage medium is fine. it's an image of an cryptovirused disk from a server
[2016-05-23 19:55:07 -0500] [shadows in #debian] trysten: what's the layout do you think? one single partition?
[2016-05-23 19:55:12 -0500] [shadows in #debian] oh
[2016-05-23 19:55:26 -0500] [shadows in #debian] offers sympathy
[2016-05-23 19:55:38 -0500] [shadows in #debian] there was no backup?
[2016-05-23 19:55:47 -0500] [shadows in #debian] not even old backup?
[2016-05-23 19:56:06 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: i know right.
[2016-05-23 19:56:32 -0500] [trysten in #debian] http://paste.debian.net/698181
[2016-05-23 19:56:50 -0500] [trysten in #debian] don't look at my disk identifier! that's personal info!
[2016-05-23 19:56:59 -0500] [shadows in #debian] well, depending how that was actuated, an old backup with the disk label and partition layout would have what you're asking about
[2016-05-23 19:57:40 -0500] [shadows in #debian] how much is the ransom?
[2016-05-23 19:58:01 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: i'm guessing the file system is fine. it's just that my favorite utility is refusing to read the partition so i was going to let it rewrite the partition table on an image
[2016-05-23 19:58:07 -0500] [shadows in #debian] may as well just have client pay it and tell them they could have avoided the cost by hiring you to help them backup their data
[2016-05-23 19:58:39 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: yes. that's where im at. however, i have some hope. the cryptovirus reached out to samba mounted folders and encrypted the contents
[2016-05-23 19:58:58 -0500] [trysten in #debian] i'm hoping that i'll be able to "undelete" at least some of the files through ntfs recovery
[2016-05-23 19:59:12 -0500] [shadows in #debian] interesting problems
[2016-05-23 19:59:17 -0500] [trysten in #debian] fun fun :D
[2016-05-23 20:00:06 -0500] [shadows in #debian] I think this is not any different than corrupted data though and some bad acting software
[2016-05-23 20:00:37 -0500] [shadows in #debian] what I would do in those cases is update the company policy, and double down on backups
[2016-05-23 20:00:49 -0500] [trysten in #debian] well like i was saying, i don't think it's corrupted at all, it's just not cooperating with testdisk
[2016-05-23 20:00:55 -0500] [shadows in #debian] that it's "cryptolocked" just is a psychological issue
[2016-05-23 20:01:07 -0500] [trysten in #debian] and technical..
[2016-05-23 20:02:16 -0500] [shadows in #debian] not really
[2016-05-23 20:03:01 -0500] [trysten in #debian] the files have been encrypted tho
[2016-05-23 20:03:18 -0500] [shadows in #debian] it's the same scenario as a disgruntled employee except, you have to treat all of your current employees as if they are disgruntled ex-employees while they're still working for you
[2016-05-23 20:03:30 -0500] [shadows in #debian] pretty great psychological quandary there
[2016-05-23 20:04:32 -0500] [trysten in #debian] haha i see. you mean cryptovirus defense

[2016-05-23 20:24:23 -0500] [Zak718 in #debian] hello
[2016-05-23 20:25:30 -0500] [Zak718 in #debian] I am trying to split a large kw list "output.txt" into seperate 30k lists. I am using the command split -l 30000 output.txt  but the output files do not have text extensions. How do i specify the output to be .txt files?
[2016-05-23 20:27:39 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] why i can not open     https://www.debian.org/   ?
[2016-05-23 20:28:01 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] The connection has timed out
[2016-05-23 20:28:02 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] The server at www.debian.org is taking too long to respond.
[2016-05-23 20:28:17 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] any one have problems  ?
[2016-05-23 20:28:23 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] im from mexico
[2016-05-23 20:28:45 -0500] [Zak718 in #debian] works fine for me
[2016-05-23 20:28:53 -0500] [LtL in #debian] AlexLikeRock: no problem here, it's your connection
[2016-05-23 20:29:03 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] Mmmm :-(
[2016-05-23 20:29:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] AlexLikeRock: works for me too. also there are "is it down?" websites you can use to check
[2016-05-23 20:30:58 -0500] [Zak718 in #debian] anyone have an answer for my split command question?
[2016-05-23 20:31:02 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] Zak718: you use the rename script after the fact
[2016-05-23 20:31:20 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian] well
[2016-05-23 20:31:22 -0500] [AlexLikeRock in #debian]  tanks
[2016-05-23 20:32:31 -0500] [Polsaker in #debian-es-offtopic] hey teraflops 
[2016-05-23 20:32:39 -0500] [Polsaker in #debian-es-offtopic] acorté un poco la url de las estadisticas: https://stats.polsaker.com/debian-es-offtopic
[2016-05-23 20:32:40 -0500] [orome in #debian-es-offtopic] Title: #debian-es-offtopic @ freenode estadísticas por Polsaker (at stats.polsaker.com)
[2016-05-23 20:34:03 -0500] [Zak718 in #debian] Alright, let me play with the rename command, I am noob =/
[2016-05-23 20:36:19 -0500] [dTal in #debian] pypi_install is so great
[2016-05-23 20:37:00 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] Hi. Do anyone know about a debian based operating system which has a virtualization wrapper around it, for easy upgrading? A desktop operating system version of coreos?
[2016-05-23 20:40:11 -0500] [dTal in #debian] although it would be nice if the built .deb didn't vanish if there's an install conflict. Oh, you had the Python2 version and they conflict? Too bad you'll have to build it all over
[2016-05-23 20:45:28 -0500] [trysten in #debian] shadows: i'm going to use LVM snapshot, which doesn't really help that much because i still have to make an additional copy of this gigantic image
[2016-05-23 20:45:41 -0500] [trysten in #debian] but yeah, it'll do what i want. if you were curious
[2016-05-23 20:46:23 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] I would really want debian to be wrapped in lxc.
[2016-05-23 20:47:28 -0500] [abrotman in #debian] So do it
[2016-05-23 20:49:37 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] so we ended up compiling the driver from source from the tarball on the realtek website
[2016-05-23 20:49:41 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] adn it worked
[2016-05-23 20:51:12 -0500] [dvs in #debian] Strange, I thought the r8169 drive would work.
[2016-05-23 20:58:31 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] hi
[2016-05-23 21:08:40 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] 8169 needs blobs
[2016-05-23 21:08:46 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] iirc
[2016-05-23 21:08:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] blob blob
[2016-05-23 21:09:43 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] blobs
[2016-05-23 21:17:39 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] abromat: How hard do you think it is?
[2016-05-23 21:18:00 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] abrotman
[2016-05-23 21:18:08 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] Sorry.
[2016-05-23 21:18:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: what are you trying to do with LXC?
[2016-05-23 21:20:35 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: I would like the containerization/isolation part of lxc would wrap the whole operating system inside a container, So I can make an iot cloud operating system which is secure for updates.
[2016-05-23 21:20:48 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] For a destkop operating system.
[2016-05-23 21:21:13 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] *just like an secure iot cloud operating system*
[2016-05-23 21:21:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: iot?
[2016-05-23 21:22:07 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] Internet of things, embedded devices which just works, with updates.
[2016-05-23 21:22:33 -0500] [markybob in #debian] maybe i'm just old but i don't understand. use chroot. you want to wrap an entire OS? yeah. we've done that for decades.
[2016-05-23 21:23:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: you want the host OS to be "wrapped" by LXC somehow? How would that make it "secure for updates"?
[2016-05-23 21:24:15 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: becouse the update mechanism would be outside of the container, in a secure place, where none can reach it.
[2016-05-23 21:24:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] nope. still don't understand. i don't know if i'm old or if the new folks are stupid.
[2016-05-23 21:25:37 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: Well. lxc provide more isolation than chroot.
[2016-05-23 21:25:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: what do you think is going to reach the upgrade mechanism in Debian as it is now? Especially if all services are running in LXC containers?
[2016-05-23 21:25:45 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] for example seccom.
[2016-05-23 21:26:15 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] *seccomp*
[2016-05-23 21:27:14 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] So Ive been trying to burn debian to a USB drive and my lenovo P50 with EFI fails to read it. Used rufus image creator, tried all the combinations, several different images, and so far the onlything that I can actually use to boot is Ubuntu :/ whats the trick to burning debian to a usb that will actually be bootable under EFI? Tried the dvd stable image, testing netinst, and both did not work :(
[2016-05-23 21:27:19 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: the os would have a service outside of the container, to trigger an update.
[2016-05-23 21:27:29 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: you did it wrong.
[2016-05-23 21:27:29 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] from inside it.
[2016-05-23 21:27:43 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: one huge container, not many small ones for each service.
[2016-05-23 21:27:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !rufus
[2016-05-23 21:27:45 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] rufus is a tool that can be used to make bootable USB devices under Windows. It is not recommended for use with Debian CD/DVD images, as it mangles the installer in cruel and unusual ways, resulting in hard to debug problems.  Ask me about <hybrid images>, <usb install>, <win32diskimager>.
[2016-05-23 21:27:54 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] for those curious, here is the blog post that got me up and going with my realtek 8168 card https://unixblogger.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/the-pain-of-an-realtek-rtl8111rtl8168-ethernet-card/
[2016-05-23 21:27:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: are you burning with windows?
[2016-05-23 21:28:02 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: yes
[2016-05-23 21:28:03 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !win32diskimager
[2016-05-23 21:28:04 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] win32diskimager is much more reliable than <unetbootin> for copying ISO images to USB sticks and you can download it from http://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/ .  Adjust the file mask from *.img to *.* if it doesn't show our .iso images.  See <usb install> and <install debian> for further details.
[2016-05-23 21:28:10 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] alright then
[2016-05-23 21:28:26 -0500] [soleluke in #debian] also, when i was burning my iso yesterday, i had much better luck with win32diskimager than any other tool
[2016-05-23 21:28:39 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: fyi live doesn't support efi
[2016-05-23 21:28:48 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: If you see here, then I would want the container lockdown security part of lxc: http://www.janoszen.com/2013/01/22/lxc-vs-openvz/
[2016-05-23 21:28:50 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] thats fine, I just want to install it
[2016-05-23 21:29:05 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: oh. so the upgrade happens in a container, and then the host OS benefits from the upgrade somehow?
[2016-05-23 21:29:08 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: ^
[2016-05-23 21:29:22 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: everything i've read about openvz makes me want to puke
[2016-05-23 21:29:23 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: no, the other way around.
[2016-05-23 21:29:31 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] any trick for keeping a dualboot with debian under efi?
[2016-05-23 21:29:51 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: no. the installer will do it automatically
[2016-05-23 21:29:52 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: I agree, but lxc also got it.
[2016-05-23 21:29:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: if you don't use live
[2016-05-23 21:30:18 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: cool
[2016-05-23 21:30:22 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: thats just a good comparision about which features is where.
[2016-05-23 21:30:32 -0500] [eifrig in #debian] ernst1405
[2016-05-23 21:30:57 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: the upgrade happens outside the container, which upgrades the content of the container (the operating system).
[2016-05-23 21:31:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/ maybe in the future there will be some systemd-nspawn and btrfs magic to do something like what you want
[2016-05-23 21:32:22 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: also what you're talking about would me changing files that running programs might have open, so stuff will still need to be restarted
[2016-05-23 21:35:08 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, thats true, But if something is hacked, the locked down part outside the container could figure out that things changed, and force trough an fix.
[2016-05-23 21:36:25 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] So this will have to be a cloud operating system, in the same was as chromeos and windows 10 is doing it.
[2016-05-23 21:36:39 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: ^
[2016-05-23 21:36:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] wait, what? chromeos in cloud? what is going on here? why? what?
[2016-05-23 21:37:20 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] I was at OSCON last week. I am so buzzworded out, I just can't even.
[2016-05-23 21:37:22 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] flees
[2016-05-23 21:38:06 -0500] [mutante in #debian] naptastic's client wasn't webscale
[2016-05-23 21:38:57 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: chromeos is a linux operating system with only chrome inside it, updates automaticly, was the first operating system who used linux kernel seccomp security feature to lock down the browser.
[2016-05-23 21:39:41 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: download it, or buy a chromebook or chromebox.
[2016-05-23 21:39:53 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] Untill then, its hard to imagine.
[2016-05-23 21:40:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: i know what chromeos is. i don't think you know what the cloud is and is just using "cloud" term as the marketing people do
[2016-05-23 21:40:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i've had several chromebooks
[2016-05-23 21:41:37 -0500] [bird_control in #debian] how do I assign permissions to /media/user/HDDUSB/Movies ? chmod -R 777 is not helping...
[2016-05-23 21:42:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bird_control: what's the filesystem?
[2016-05-23 21:42:08 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: Yeah, I guess I used that word a littlebit wrong. But it feels good when you can send a message to google and make them call you up to fix it.
[2016-05-23 21:42:17 -0500] [bird_control in #debian] its an external hdd and I believe its NTFS...
[2016-05-23 21:42:34 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bird_control: so that's why. ntfs has no idea what 777 is
[2016-05-23 21:42:55 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bird_control: chown it
[2016-05-23 21:43:32 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: have you tried it?:p
[2016-05-23 21:44:05 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: 02:40 < markybob> i've had several chromebooks
[2016-05-23 21:44:23 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: I meant, tried sending in a support ticket..?
[2016-05-23 21:44:28 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] to google.
[2016-05-23 21:44:34 -0500] [bird_control in #debian] markybob chown it. just chown /folder/folder.. ?
[2016-05-23 21:44:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: of course
[2016-05-23 21:45:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bird_control: no. you want to do chown -R user:user /folder/wtf
[2016-05-23 21:46:15 -0500] [markybob in #debian] bird_control: as root/sudo obviously
[2016-05-23 21:46:19 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: ok :-) did you know that windows 10 have such a container techology?
[2016-05-23 21:46:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: i don't know anything about windows.
[2016-05-23 21:46:39 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] Maybe wrong channel to ask about that :-p
[2016-05-23 21:47:05 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: ok. did you still not understand my idea?
[2016-05-23 21:48:25 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: it did not work, my bios is not letting me boot that image :(
[2016-05-23 21:48:35 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: i get the idea. i don't know how it works or why you want it. chroot was always good to me. *shrug*
[2016-05-23 21:49:30 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: you never told me what image you used.
[2016-05-23 21:49:44 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] debian stable 8.4 dvd from the main page
[2016-05-23 21:50:39 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: renamed the iso to img and burned it
[2016-05-23 21:50:48 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: see, shit like that makes people irritated. main page if you click on download gives you multiarch netinst. so we can't trust what you say
[2016-05-23 21:51:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] not dvd
[2016-05-23 21:51:45 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: you are right, was booting to get the name: debian-8.40-amd64-DVD-1.iso
[2016-05-23 21:52:08 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] just typed that, so it might not be the exact name.
[2016-05-23 21:53:12 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] the weird part is, the ubuntu image I burned using rufus boots just fine, I wonder what I am missing to make the debian image work
[2016-05-23 21:53:16 -0500] [Artemis3 in #debian] no legacy/CSM mode in that laptop?
[2016-05-23 21:53:35 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] Artemis3: there is, but I want to keep EFI on
[2016-05-23 21:53:45 -0500] [Artemis3 in #debian] are you dual booting?
[2016-05-23 21:53:50 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] thats the intention
[2016-05-23 21:53:51 -0500] [markybob in #debian] the difference is debian uses hybrid isos
[2016-05-23 21:53:57 -0500] [bird_control in #debian] I just chowned my external hdd. I am a chowner.
[2016-05-23 21:54:00 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vlitzer: you used win32diskimager this time?
[2016-05-23 21:54:05 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] jmcnaught: yes
[2016-05-23 21:54:09 -0500] [Artemis3 in #debian] vlitzer, if you haven't installed the other OS, then it doesn't matter
[2016-05-23 21:54:29 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] Artemis3: currently only w10 and an empty space for my linux resides on my hd
[2016-05-23 21:54:47 -0500] [Artemis3 in #debian] vlitzer, ok then you already have it installed, nvm.
[2016-05-23 21:55:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vlitzer: what happens when you try to boot? do you get a chance to select the USB drive? is there an error?
[2016-05-23 21:56:12 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] nothing, it just sits there like there was no boot medium
[2016-05-23 21:56:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] vlitzer: does it work on a different computer?
[2016-05-23 21:57:30 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] I can try it on my x230, although it has traditional MBR since I disabled efi on that one
[2016-05-23 21:57:50 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: doesn't matter. he wants to know if the burn/usb is good
[2016-05-23 21:58:20 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] markybob: jmcnaught: yes trying now
[2016-05-23 21:58:44 -0500] [Artemis3 in #debian] vlitzer, i assume you have secure boot disabled yes?
[2016-05-23 21:59:04 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: chroot removes the whole operating system on file level. seccomp does it on an application process level, so its impossible to get out of it, even if it runs on the same files. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp
[2016-05-23 21:59:51 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Sander^home: i'm not ignorant on what it does. i just don't understand the why. :P
[2016-05-23 22:00:54 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, those guys making systemupdates might make the btrfs image snapshots outside of a seccomp container.
[2016-05-23 22:01:39 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] image boots just fine on my x230. No, I did not disable secure boot
[2016-05-23 22:02:17 -0500] [dvs in #debian] that's why
[2016-05-23 22:02:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: which guys?
[2016-05-23 22:02:56 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: that was for you btw
[2016-05-23 22:02:59 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] but I dont want to disable EFI
[2016-05-23 22:03:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] vlitzer: debain does not support secure boot
[2016-05-23 22:03:13 -0500] [vlitzer in #debian] :(
[2016-05-23 22:03:13 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] markybob: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/
[2016-05-23 22:03:20 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: sorry^
[2016-05-23 22:04:25 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: oh yes. what they're talking about though is booting the computer into a special "upgrades" target that does the upgrades, and then reboots again into the normal target
[2016-05-23 22:06:50 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: I think its more sexy to use seccomp, and not require two reboots, but I love that option aswell.
[2016-05-23 22:07:26 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: anything that changes will still need to be restarted
[2016-05-23 22:08:22 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: Yes, but none will notice a diffrence from how it is now, with the upgrades, they will need to be restarted today too.
[2016-05-23 22:09:52 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: problem is when the operating system alters the upgrades target.
[2016-05-23 22:10:30 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: what is the problem?
[2016-05-23 22:10:30 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] If its inside seccomp, you can make it not be able to alter the upgrades target.
[2016-05-23 22:11:28 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: compromised servers.
[2016-05-23 22:11:43 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] or even, desktop systems.
[2016-05-23 22:12:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: you're explaining the threat or attack vector here. Altering the upgrade target is the point of upgrades. Is there going to be some test that the upgrade was applied properly before the target it upgraded or something?
[2016-05-23 22:13:15 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: anyways, probably better to move this to #debian-offtopic since it's not really support
[2016-05-23 22:13:43 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: ok.
[2016-05-23 22:14:50 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: Hi:)
[2016-05-23 22:16:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: so i don't understand what you think will happen during upgrades that would lead to a compromised server
[2016-05-23 22:16:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] and how doing the upgrade in a container would prevent that from happening
[2016-05-23 22:16:42 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Assuming one or more of you do, how do you manage automatic decryption of an ecryptfs ~ volume with a key and passphrase based ssh login with password verification disabled in sshd?
[2016-05-23 22:17:00 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: If you take the architecture of coreos, then they do it right.
[2016-05-23 22:17:14 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I have a system to manage this presently on a headless server, but I feel it to be...inelegant.
[2016-05-23 22:17:19 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] But they dont do desktop machines, only servers.
[2016-05-23 22:17:42 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] ok
[2016-05-23 22:18:21 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] they basicly have a very small footprint in the global scope. with basicly just a kernel.
[2016-05-23 22:19:15 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] and they use lxc as a wrapper around where the applications is running.
[2016-05-23 22:20:21 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] as coreos's small fotprint operating system is so small, then its easy to test that it works to upgrade it, so they can do it live, without reboots.
[2016-05-23 22:21:06 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] I remember there is a few options for live upgrades, even tho its not very stable, then coreos can make it stable.
[2016-05-23 22:21:24 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Live kernel upgrades.
[2016-05-23 22:21:27 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] My current solution is a small script at ~/.bash_login.d/10-ecryptfs.sh (~/.bash_login is modified to run all the scriptlets in .bash_login.d) that I have dropped in the unencrypted version of my user's $HOME, and this checks if it is an ecryptfs volume and if automount is true.
[2016-05-23 22:22:00 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] And regarding that, if you wrap the applications inside seccomp, youll avoid trampering with the kernel.
[2016-05-23 22:22:23 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Then it does ecryptfs-mount-private, and I get the prompt for the passphrase, then it drops into the decrypted home and begins sourcing my dotfiles and such.
[2016-05-23 22:23:07 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] and then btrfs snapshots is a nice to have feature which can be built upon to do this: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/
[2016-05-23 22:23:56 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I guess what I'm asking is, "Is there a better way to do this?", given the caveats of: ssh based login, ssh key+passphrase, password based login disabled, headless environment.
[2016-05-23 22:25:01 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: what will lead to a compromised server, is someone getting root, and installing something into the kernel to keep it. With seccomp, they wont be able to install that lkm.
[2016-05-23 22:26:44 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] I'm not sure if seccomp can wrap a whole operating system, so far its only been used for single applications.
[2016-05-23 22:27:30 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: see?
[2016-05-23 22:28:44 -0500] [shadows in #debian] trysten: good luck!
[2016-05-23 22:35:40 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: do you know about seccomp filtering in systemd?
[2016-05-23 22:38:23 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: no, interesting, reading this: https://lwn.net/Articles/507067/
[2016-05-23 22:40:17 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: yeah, check out SystemCallFilter= in systemd.exec(5)
[2016-05-23 22:41:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] systemd implements a lot of this isolation stuff without containers
[2016-05-23 22:43:02 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] [Saint]: seems like ecryptfs-utils comes with a pam module, have you tried using that?
[2016-05-23 22:43:04 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Where do you see that?
[2016-05-23 22:43:21 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught:
[2016-05-23 22:43:23 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] Polsaker, jaja, que verguenza!
[2016-05-23 22:44:12 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] Polsaker, los logs voy a tener que arreglarlos, quitarle los join/part y dejar solo las conversaciones, pero si se pueden usar xD
[2016-05-23 22:45:29 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Just to make sure we get the same thing. Systemd should not be isolated, it should do the isolation of everything else.
[2016-05-23 22:45:57 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: i think i understand the solution you're proposing, but not the problem it's trying to solve
[2016-05-23 22:46:00 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] yes, but there's a few bugs against it marked as WONTFIX as far as I recall. It would work if I was using password based login on ssh, or if I didn't use an encrypted home volume, or possibly if I was using a full desktop environment.
[2016-05-23 22:46:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] what i'm saying about systemd though is that it has isolation features. look at "man systemd.exec" for some of the things it can restrict for services
[2016-05-23 22:46:45 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: to avoid beeing able to use loadable kernel modules.
[2016-05-23 22:47:27 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: and to make sure every file is overwritten properly during an upgrade.
[2016-05-23 22:49:11 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Its basicly a mouse and cat job, to avoid beeing compromised, this will be able to fix a system after its beeing compromised.
[2016-05-23 22:50:44 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: so now it's constantly scanning for altered files on the OS too?
[2016-05-23 22:51:20 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: that can be done, however you already have services for that, like chkrootkit and rkhunter.
[2016-05-23 22:52:04 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] which idieally should be installed in the global scope.
[2016-05-23 22:52:24 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] ideally*
[2016-05-23 22:52:52 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] jmcnaught: My Google Fu is /fairly/ strong, and everything I find on the subject suggests that with the setup I describe that automatic decryption over ssh in any seamless fashion isn't possible.
[2016-05-23 22:53:30 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] So basicly, everything installed in the global scope should be specially marked for code verification, and need to have a special purpose to be there.
[2016-05-23 22:53:52 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I understand why this is the case, I was just wondering how other people manage this, as I feel like I can't be the only one with key and passphrase based ssh login with password disabled and a ecryptfs home volume.
[2016-05-23 22:53:54 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] [Saint]: i don't know i've never used ecryptfs. is the problem that you use keys for SSH and the pam module needs a password?
[2016-05-23 22:54:10 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Everything else can be in the underlying os, and can be altered by the global scope.
[2016-05-23 22:54:13 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Right.
[2016-05-23 22:54:30 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] the other way around shouldnt be possible.
[2016-05-23 22:55:09 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] So I was wondering how people automate handing off to encryptfs-mount-private after ssh authentication and then drop into the newly decrypted home and source the environment dotfiles.
[2016-05-23 22:55:30 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I already have a solution for this that is functional, but it feels ugly to me.
[2016-05-23 22:55:48 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] So I am more than curious, lets say, about any solutions for this that others may have.
[2016-05-23 22:56:09 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] would requiring key AND password be acceptable?
[2016-05-23 22:57:46 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Hmmm. I guess I could do key+passphrase+password, in typical 'thinking about it too hard' fashion I had not actually considered that.
[2016-05-23 22:58:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Seldon: systemd has ProtectSystem=
[2016-05-23 22:59:08 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] you could sell it as two factor authentication :)
[2016-05-23 23:00:12 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: do you have a link inside github?
[2016-05-23 23:00:35 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Hah. I already do have yubikey based 2FA as well. As well as user/hostname/MAC and port knock code checking.
[2016-05-23 23:00:59 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] I doubt the latter could really be thought of as additional factors though.
[2016-05-23 23:01:14 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] But my ssh is somewhat militant, yes. Indeed.
[2016-05-23 23:01:24 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] https://github.com/systemd/systemd/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ProtectSystem%3D&type=Code
[2016-05-23 23:01:27 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] I guess.
[2016-05-23 23:03:11 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: do you want to read the source code for it, or its documentation? most of what i've talked about is in "man systemd.exec"
[2016-05-23 23:07:09 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] The man page explained it pretty good.
[2016-05-23 23:08:14 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: so i think as we go forward in the systemd error services are going to be more an more isolated from each other
[2016-05-23 23:08:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] heh freudian slip s/error/era/
[2016-05-23 23:09:28 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: do you know which operating systems have systemd so far?
[2016-05-23 23:09:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] linux!
[2016-05-23 23:10:15 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] why am I awake at 6am
[2016-05-23 23:11:06 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] Thanks for not being #ubuntu, by the way.
[2016-05-23 23:11:29 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] First response I get is polite, genuine, and actually helpful.
[2016-05-23 23:11:29 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jelly: Linux is my reason, yes:)
[2016-05-23 23:11:33 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] hehe
[2016-05-23 23:11:44 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: do you mean which distros? lots of them. other OSs don't have systemd
[2016-05-23 23:11:47 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] yes
[2016-05-23 23:11:49 -0500] [[Saint] in #debian] The exact opposite of #ubuntu - I was kinda iffy about even asking here.
[2016-05-23 23:11:57 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] which distros
[2016-05-23 23:12:11 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] this is a decent channel for sure
[2016-05-23 23:12:25 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] at this point probably everything but gentoo
[2016-05-23 23:13:17 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] even the small ones like puppy?
[2016-05-23 23:16:24 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Is there a list somewhere of when it was introduced?
[2016-05-23 23:16:37 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd
[2016-05-23 23:17:10 -0500] [rjsalts in #debian-offtopic] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#Adoption_and_reception more specifically
[2016-05-23 23:18:13 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] Thanks. And which file do I need to edit and commands do I need to execute, to do a full lockdown?
[2016-05-23 23:19:32 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Sander^home: you'll probably need to ask a more specific question, but in #debian :)
[2016-05-23 23:22:32 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian] jmcnaught: how do I set ProtectSystem= in systemd to full? or is this enabled by default?
[2016-05-23 23:26:39 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: ProtectSystem= is a directive you can use in service units. "man systemd.unit" talks about units in general, and shows how to use foo.service.d directories to add/override directives for a unit
[2016-05-23 23:27:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: "man systemd.service" for more specific information about service units, and check the "SEE ALSO" sections for each man page too
[2016-05-23 23:29:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Sander^home: if you're brand new to systemd the blog series is a good introduction: https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/#thesystemdforadministratorsblogseries
[2016-05-23 23:45:07 -0500] [Sander^home in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: I think that ProtectSystem dosnt protect against enough. It didnt take the latest kernel root vulnerability, as that targeted the /proc filesystem.
