[2016-05-13 16:32:01 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] try htop
[2016-05-13 16:32:14 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] how much ram did it consume before you install desktop?
[2016-05-13 16:32:26 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] i dont know :(
[2016-05-13 16:32:32 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] but i guess a lot less
[2016-05-13 16:32:35 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] so how do you know how much it grow?
[2016-05-13 16:32:43 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] im using 230Mb ram
[2016-05-13 16:32:57 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] ill start vnc now, xfce4 and i'll tell you the difference
[2016-05-13 16:33:36 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] no changes, as it was running even if not moving on
[2016-05-13 16:33:54 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] 231Mb ram and 174Mb on swap
[2016-05-13 16:34:03 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] use htop and look what's taking your memory
[2016-05-13 16:34:17 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] apt-get install htop
[2016-05-13 16:34:24 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] xfce4 has also a task manager i guess
[2016-05-13 16:35:43 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] what takes memory are the multiple process xcfe-panel xcfe4-terminal xfdesktop
[2016-05-13 16:37:25 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] seems you're not looking good the Mb meter
[2016-05-13 16:37:42 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] free command doesn't tell you clearly how much memory is ACTUALLY being used
[2016-05-13 16:37:52 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] look at google for "linuxatemyram"
[2016-05-13 16:37:57 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] then understand it
[2016-05-13 16:38:09 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] later, install htop and you'll have a good coloured graph about your system resources
[2016-05-13 16:38:20 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] htop is terminal based
[2016-05-13 16:38:50 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] is top on steroids, more like a task-manager on the cli
[2016-05-13 16:39:06 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] erm3nda , i had htop already installed
[2016-05-13 16:39:14 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] and it's reporting the same as free -h
[2016-05-13 16:39:32 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] porque haces -rf en en un script, recursivo es para directorios
[2016-05-13 16:41:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] x-fak: it's because you don't understand what cached memory is. you didn't google like you were told
[2016-05-13 16:43:40 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] x-fak, if you have 866M available, out of 1G, there shouldn't be a problem?
[2016-05-13 16:43:56 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ah well, good night.
[2016-05-13 16:44:19 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Good night TomTomTosch. I was off rereading rsync's man.
[2016-05-13 16:45:41 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ah, reading man pages, always a good thing x)

[2016-05-13 16:47:21 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] frostschutz http://pastebin.com/Wbugrz4g
[2016-05-13 16:48:25 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] x-fak, that's 71M used, 952M free
[2016-05-13 16:49:59 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] frostschutz , ok i have to check the cache line
[2016-05-13 16:50:16 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] x-fak, it's normal for linux to use all free ram for caching (until something actually needs ram for something else). it even swaps out unused stuff to have even more ram for caching. with slow hdds caching is a huge performance bonus and the ram is there to be used
[2016-05-13 16:52:07 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] frostschutz , ok
[2016-05-13 16:54:24 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] as i understand the proper way to check actual avalaible ram is checking the BUFFER/CACHE
[2016-05-13 16:55:09 -0500] [bit1 in #debian-es] hola

[2016-05-13 17:09:17 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] I copied an x86_64 debian live .iso to a flash drive and it boots on an old (non-UEFI) laptop but not my new UEFI laptop. How can I get it to boot on the latter?
[2016-05-13 17:09:21 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] x-fak: did you read http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ ?
[2016-05-13 17:09:57 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] aaronm04: Debian's Live media doesn't support UEFI... i'd suggest using the installer (if that's what you're doing)
[2016-05-13 17:10:14 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] ah, so the problem is not with using .iso files in general?
[2016-05-13 17:10:41 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] aaronm04: Live = YES... netinst = NO...
[2016-05-13 17:10:48 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] zykotick9: thanks!
[2016-05-13 17:11:03 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] aaronm04: cd1/dvd1 also work with UEFI (not JUST netinst)
[2016-05-13 17:11:12 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] I wanted to 1) try out different desktop environments, and then 2) install Debian on my new laptop. I guess I can do #1 on the old laptop
[2016-05-13 17:12:20 -0500] [consolejazz in #debian] my `/etc/apt-sources.list` file contains the following https://paste.debian.net/683808/ . I need a proprietary software package and will need to add the `non-free` component . Do I need to do this for both lines? i.e., `deb http://httpredir.debian.org...` AND `deb http://security.debian.org...`?
[2016-05-13 17:12:22 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] bueno tios me voy
[2016-05-13 17:13:22 -0500] [consolejazz in #debian] *should* I be doing it for both lines.. so that I ensure the package and any dependencies also get security updates (if that's how things actually work on that second line)?
[2016-05-13 17:14:32 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] zykotick9 , i've read it now
[2016-05-13 17:14:51 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] i understand better
[2016-05-13 17:15:13 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es]  Hola. Estoy probando GeexBox para reutilizar una compu vieja. Funciona perfecto pero cuando intento reemplazar el monitor por el proyector de la escuela el sistema no inicia. Si inicio con monitor y lo cambio por el proyector no hay problema. ¿Alguien tiene idea?
[2016-05-13 17:20:30 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] GabrielGF:  Eso es como una distro pa equipos viejos.
[2016-05-13 17:27:40 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] if I do `sudo -i` to get a root shell, then bash-completion is available. but if I then do `bash` to get a subshell, bash-completion isn't available
[2016-05-13 17:27:45 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] does that seem sane/right?
[2016-05-13 17:29:17 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] am I expected to just never start random subshells, or always start them with `bash -l` or something?
[2016-05-13 17:32:14 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Dagger: works here. you probably don't have the bash-completion crap in /root/.bashrc like you do in /home/user/.bashrc
[2016-05-13 17:32:16 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] ZombieAlive:   podes ayuda en esto: en debian quiero  hacer server pxe multiboot distro linux, windows, etc pero server que asigne ips alas clientes sea router.
[2016-05-13 17:32:24 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] entedite?

[2016-05-13 17:32:35 -0500] [DELLtra in #debian-es] ya te dje proxmox
[2016-05-13 17:32:45 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] eso para virtualizar
[2016-05-13 17:32:47 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: what markybob said. You could try bash -x to see exactly what is happening when it starts up
[2016-05-13 17:33:01 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] ya uso virtual box para pxcs virtuales en debian
[2016-05-13 17:33:08 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es]  quiero hacer eso pero pc virtual

[2016-05-13 17:34:22 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  Entendi todo al pelo. Pero un PXE es para arrancar varias imagenes en una red y hacer instalaciones distribuidas hasta donde se eso es así.
[2016-05-13 17:34:29 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] promox es distro virtualizar maquinas. yo mi server tengo instalado debian con virtualbox. quiero hacer pregunte es hacerlo en una maquina virtual en mi server
[2016-05-13 17:34:34 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  Usa KVM amigo.
[2016-05-13 17:34:43 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] markybob: that's correct, but why is the bash-completion stuff in ~user/.bashrc at all when it's also in /etc/profile.d/?
[2016-05-13 17:35:00 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: profile only gets sourced on login shells.
[2016-05-13 17:35:20 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: you'd want it in /etc/bash.bashrc
[2016-05-13 17:35:22 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] tengo maquina virtual con debian solo falta tutorialo algo asi hacer andar server pxe
[2016-05-13 17:35:23 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  Virtualbox sirve para MV de a raticos pero para uso intensivo lo mejor es qemu-kvm si lo quieres gestionar gráficamente usas virt-manager.
[2016-05-13 17:35:49 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] so why's it in /etc/profile.d/ and not /etc/bash.bashrc?
[2016-05-13 17:36:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] he just told you the difference
[2016-05-13 17:36:29 -0500] [markybob in #debian] or you could just learn to type :P
[2016-05-13 17:36:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] you cant tell me apt-g<tab> is that much faster than apt-get
[2016-05-13 17:37:16 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] I'm just trying to work out why things are as they are :p
[2016-05-13 17:37:26 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] igual gracias
[2016-05-13 17:37:36 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] chau
[2016-05-13 17:37:57 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] markybob: it's things like `invoke-rc.d <name>` where bash-completion is useful
[2016-05-13 17:37:58 -0500] [DELLtra in #debian-es] renog no te vayas
[2016-05-13 17:38:05 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] markybob: you get that completion regardless. What's useful is completing for instance package names after apt-get install
[2016-05-13 17:38:06 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] maybe not but apt-g<tab> in<tab> build-e<tab> could save an amount of time on the order of 2 seconds
[2016-05-13 17:38:24 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  No entiendo yo tengo entendido que pxe es para hacer arrancar OS en otras maquinas y el Server sea quien cargue los procesos de manera distribuida.
[2016-05-13 17:38:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] pukes
[2016-05-13 17:38:25 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] but what I'm really trying to do is source all the scripts in ~/.bash_aliases.d/, and I'm trying to work out where I'm supposed to do it from
[2016-05-13 17:38:27 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: I don't know why it's in profile.d, but it's also in bash.bashrc, just commended out
[2016-05-13 17:38:49 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  No se si me equivoque.
[2016-05-13 17:38:51 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] and then I thought "hey, bash-completion is just a bunch of aliases too. how does that get loaded into every shell?"
[2016-05-13 17:38:52 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: ~/.bashrc if you want it for the individual user, /etc/bash.bashrc if you want it for all users.
[2016-05-13 17:39:04 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] nah, bash_completion isn't aliases
[2016-05-13 17:39:09 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] and it turns out it doesn't. and the loading which does happen seems like it's a mess
[2016-05-13 17:39:10 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] facil decir
[2016-05-13 17:39:22 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] functions*

[2016-05-13 17:39:53 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] cenrtralizaba trabajaba seguridad todo estaba en el server
[2016-05-13 17:40:17 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Is there a way to get grub working on debian using the linuxefi/initrdefi commands rather than linux/initrd? As is, grub complains about an invalid signature / no signature (can't remember the exact error message, but it's regarding signatures either way). I don't think I can disable secure boot on my machine (it's a mac).
[2016-05-13 17:40:28 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] idea trabajar todo remotamente desde server. como un cibero para una escuela
[2016-05-13 17:40:36 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] I tried zsh. I couldn't get over how its "alt+N alt+." pasting numbered the arguments in the reverse order to bash
[2016-05-13 17:42:17 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] ZombieAlive:  bios de las pc activa esa funcion aranque en red
[2016-05-13 17:42:23 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] so is the conclusion just that bash-completion loading in Debian is buggy unless you manually fix it?
[2016-05-13 17:42:24 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] eso es pxe
[2016-05-13 17:42:40 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] or is it me that's wrong for expecting `bash` to give me another functioning shell?
[2016-05-13 17:43:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it works if you manually fix it. at least on my box that i just tested. now i'm removing it :P
[2016-05-13 17:44:24 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] rengo:  Exacto se lo que es... Yo lo uso para arrancar varias maquinas y hacer un copia de una instalación en varias a la vez.

[2016-05-13 17:46:58 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] my _real_ real problem is that I can't see a sane way to edit bash.bashrc from ansible, and there's no .d folder for it like there is profile.d so I can't just drop a file in somewhere
[2016-05-13 17:47:17 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] so I was kinda hoping that profile.d _was_ the right way to do this >.>

[2016-05-13 18:04:08 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Dagger: zsh is very configurable, I'm sure the alt+N alt+. thing is just a default
[2016-05-13 18:04:16 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] and it has the most wonderul completion
[2016-05-13 18:04:53 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_Linux
[2016-05-13 18:05:15 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] sphalerite: I couldn't find an option for it. which wasn't helped by having no idea what the paste thing is actually called
[2016-05-13 18:05:39 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] sphalerite: honestly the main thing I want from zsh is multi-component path completion
[2016-05-13 18:05:53 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] /e/n/i -> /etc/network/interfaces is so, so useful
[2016-05-13 18:06:07 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] deb:
[2016-05-13 18:06:25 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] diga
[2016-05-13 18:06:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] that wouldn't even work
[2016-05-13 18:06:43 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Hola <deb>  Baje esa distro pero no me anduvo en la máquina que quiero usar. En cambio la geexbox funciona muy bien. El único problema es que cuando quiero que arranque directamente con el cañón enchufado no funciona
[2016-05-13 18:06:45 -0500] [markybob in #debian] network/newt/nvidia/nwhatever
[2016-05-13 18:06:54 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] that actually makes my brain hurt a little
[2016-05-13 18:07:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it's awfully painful
[2016-05-13 18:07:14 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] "/e/n/in" then
[2016-05-13 18:07:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] still doesn't work
[2016-05-13 18:07:21 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Como es para uso en una escuela no quiero que tengan acceso a nada más que a la multimedia
[2016-05-13 18:07:23 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] which would expand to /etc/network/interfaces{,d}
[2016-05-13 18:07:24 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] en esa compu
[2016-05-13 18:07:26 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] works in zsh
[2016-05-13 18:07:31 -0500] [markybob in #debian] let's learn how to use linux properly
[2016-05-13 18:07:33 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] tab-completion is one thing
[2016-05-13 18:07:39 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, geexbox tiene xbmc pre-instalado, que es el viejo, el kodi es el mas nuevo
[2016-05-13 18:07:41 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] deb:  pv. por favor
[2016-05-13 18:08:06 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] ambiguous referencing of directory names... oww
[2016-05-13 18:08:10 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] well, it depends whether you have any other files matching the glob /e*/n*/in*
[2016-05-13 18:08:16 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] I don't, so it'd work
[2016-05-13 18:08:37 -0500] [markybob in #debian] that's why it's insane. different machines will give you different results. you need to use basics
[2016-05-13 18:08:48 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] ac1dh0n3ycl0ud: it's not ambiguous if only one of the directories has a file beginning with "in" in it
[2016-05-13 18:09:10 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] markybob: that's true for all tab completion
[2016-05-13 18:09:15 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Dagger: by ambiguous I just mean "not being explicit"
[2016-05-13 18:09:17 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yeah, so i don't use it
[2016-05-13 18:09:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] but it's much better than what you're talking about
[2016-05-13 18:09:36 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] why wouldn't you?
[2016-05-13 18:09:48 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] ok. well. I find tab completion kinda useful, so I do use it
[2016-05-13 18:10:15 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] it's just annoying to have to tab complete each individual path component one-by-one in bash when I know zsh has a multi-component complete that works fine
[2016-05-13 18:10:17 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Wait so I'm lost are you typing /e/n/in<tab> or /e<tab>/n<tab>/in<tab>?
[2016-05-13 18:10:27 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, y ya hay otra version mas nueva que kodi, igual si no te agarro el proyector, deveras usar otra distro o ver si esa distro tiene drivers para tu proyector
[2016-05-13 18:10:31 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] the first one, right?
[2016-05-13 18:10:32 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] ac1dh0n3ycl0ud: in zsh? "/e/n/in<tab>"
[2016-05-13 18:10:35 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] yeah
[2016-05-13 18:11:06 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Yeah... at that point I'd just use an alias
[2016-05-13 18:11:10 -0500] [rengo in #debian-es] chau chicos cuidesey gracias
[2016-05-13 18:11:17 -0500] [markybob in #debian] ac1dh0n3ycl0ud: amen
[2016-05-13 18:11:17 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Lo que yo digo es de usar alguna configuración forzada. Si arranco con monitor y después lo desconecto y enchufo el cañón, todo funciona. ¿Se entiende?
[2016-05-13 18:11:40 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] `cd /ein`->`cd /etc/network/interfaces`
[2016-05-13 18:11:48 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] you can't make an alias for every file you might ever want to tab complete
[2016-05-13 18:11:52 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, tu problema no es xbmx/kodi o etc, tu problema es de incompativilidad de hardware, prueba otra version, ubuntu, etc, y metes xbmc en cuando veas que si reconoce el proyector.
[2016-05-13 18:12:17 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] no but I can hit tab more than once without breaking a sweat
[2016-05-13 18:12:49 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] sure, so can I, it just gets annoying when you're slowly tab completing through a deep path and having to resolve ambiguous completes at every level
[2016-05-13 18:13:03 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, si lo entiendo, tu geexbox no arranca sin monitor, eso es raro
[2016-05-13 18:13:16 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Sure but what I don't understand is if /e/n/i is ambiguous
[2016-05-13 18:13:27 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] like if you have an /etc/nmap/
[2016-05-13 18:13:45 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] */etc/namp/i.+
[2016-05-13 18:14:03 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] then you'd have to start typing /e/ne/i
[2016-05-13 18:14:20 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] which you'd only learn if you used that path a lot
[2016-05-13 18:14:24 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] or "/e/n/inter<tab>" or something
[2016-05-13 18:14:29 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] sure
[2016-05-13 18:14:47 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Fue muy frustrante. La tenía super preparada a la máquina y cuando la lleve a probar con el proyector no arranco. Le saque el proyector y probe como digo y funcionó lo más bien
[2016-05-13 18:14:50 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] maybe I'm just old-school
[2016-05-13 18:15:11 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] no se puede hacer que se quede con la configuración que yo quiero y que no pruebe nada al arranque
[2016-05-13 18:15:13 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] ??
[2016-05-13 18:15:25 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] no entiendo la gente, quiere que le ayudes instalar un asterisk o un pxe en una maquina virtual de su casa, wtf! para eso estan los manuales, ahi pruebas y si no va, entonces preguntas, que nos ven cara de escuela o que?
[2016-05-13 18:15:37 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] maybe it's so engrained into my brain that one should complete paths one directory at a time
[2016-05-13 18:15:38 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] which would be far less annoying than what happens in bash, which is usually something like "/e<tab>/n<tab><tab><sigh>e<tab>/i<tab>"
[2016-05-13 18:16:41 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] preguntale a geexbox, seguro te diran que linux usan y etc, yo desconozco
[2016-05-13 18:16:53 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] it feels like you're being interrupted constantly on every path component. it's much nicer to type multiple parts in at once
[2016-05-13 18:17:00 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] or at least, to be able to do so
[2016-05-13 18:17:11 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] so I know that I have to type cd /home/d<tab>/.ss<tab> to get /home/devon/.ssh
[2016-05-13 18:17:23 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] hi Lady_Aleena
[2016-05-13 18:17:23 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] which I do every so often
[2016-05-13 18:17:46 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] but with /opt/Projects it's /o<tab>/P<tab>
[2016-05-13 18:17:57 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] and then if I'm in one directory a lot
[2016-05-13 18:18:09 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] I'll create a symlink to the directory I'm working in
[2016-05-13 18:18:22 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Voy a probar. Mi ingles no es muy bueno
[2016-05-13 18:18:46 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] called /opt/Projects/zz that points -> /opt/Projects/ponychat/src/net/
[2016-05-13 18:19:02 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] but if I don't use it a lot I'd rather walk the whole directory
[2016-05-13 18:19:20 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Hello tortib.
[2016-05-13 18:19:37 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] le puedes meter debian 32bits, si dices es demaciado vieja y probar, si te va, metes xbmc y ya haz de cuenta que es lo mismo que esa cosa
[2016-05-13 18:19:53 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I'm dealing with technical things in another channel. Sorry I didn't see your greeting right away. 8)
[2016-05-13 18:20:03 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] and see every /etc/n.+/ named directory so I know
[2016-05-13 18:20:03 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] No worries
[2016-05-13 18:20:07 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] what's where....
[2016-05-13 18:20:17 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] but I see where you're coming from
[2016-05-13 18:21:19 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, feeling better about yourself today?
[2016-05-13 18:21:22 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] you could always just do "/etc/n<tab>" if you really wanted to know...
[2016-05-13 18:21:31 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I haven't really thought about myself today
[2016-05-13 18:21:36 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I kind of like it that way
[2016-05-13 18:21:42 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Good deal.
[2016-05-13 18:22:01 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Ja ja. ¿Por qué "esa cosa"?
[2016-05-13 18:22:19 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Tengo un servidor montado con debian en otra máquina igual
[2016-05-13 18:22:24 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] it's just annoying to get as far as "/e<tab>/n<tab>" and have bash present you with a list of possible completions, most of which you *know* are useless because you're about to add "/inter<tab>" and only one folder has that file in it
[2016-05-13 18:22:47 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] So Bethesda creators of the new Doom decided it will pull a EA move and charge $40 for a years worth of DLC
[2016-05-13 18:22:50 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] but bash can't know that, because it has no way for you to tell it that
[2016-05-13 18:22:54 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] so $40 a year
[2016-05-13 18:23:08 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] ¿Se puede hacer que xmbc funcione como interface gráfica y quitar todo acceso al sistema y a otras aplicaciones?

[2016-05-13 18:23:56 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I'm not really inclined to pay $40 a year just to pay more for the same stuff that should have been in the game to begin with
[2016-05-13 18:24:11 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i like to stay a generation behind current gaming platforms, and purchase all my games used
[2016-05-13 18:24:25 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] That's a good strategy
[2016-05-13 18:24:39 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I have a PS3, hardly play it
[2016-05-13 18:24:49 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't really play any games
[2016-05-13 18:25:00 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Doom has been the exception because it's a good Franchise
[2016-05-13 18:25:26 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] this wasn't something I realized I wanted until I used it in zsh. but now I want it, and bash can't do it :(
[2016-05-13 18:26:11 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I tried playing Doom when it was newish, but I always died within the first 2 minutes, so quit.
[2016-05-13 18:26:18 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] GabrielGF: SI claro instalas kodi-standalone e inicias ya sea desde xinitrc o desde el gestor lightdm; slim; SDDM.

[2016-05-13 18:27:11 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] Lo añades en el inicio del gestor de ventanas.
[2016-05-13 18:27:13 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Videos games should only require two controls, a joystick and a fire button. Any more than that, and it becomes too complicated.
[2016-05-13 18:27:23 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] that's how doom was lol
[2016-05-13 18:27:34 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] but the new doom is much different
[2016-05-13 18:27:35 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] "esa cosa" -> geexbox
[2016-05-13 18:27:45 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Buenísimo. Gracias a todos. Calculo que debe andar ya que como les digo debian agarro viaje de una.
[2016-05-13 18:27:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, I was trying to play with a mouse and a keyboard back then.
[2016-05-13 18:27:51 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] ya got frag grenades, alternate firiing for your weapon
[2016-05-13 18:27:58 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Si, entendí que te referias a geexbox
[2016-05-13 18:28:08 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, that is actually a skill you develop over time
[2016-05-13 18:28:20 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] pero por que esa cosa? Es un enjendro pero salvo por lo del cañón venia muy bien
[2016-05-13 18:28:25 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] when doing that you're being ambidexterous (spelling)
[2016-05-13 18:28:28 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, since I kept dying, I got bored with it quickly.
[2016-05-13 18:28:31 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] using both arms/hands at once
[2016-05-13 18:29:11 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Oh, and I didn't have a manual so didn't know what I was doing.
[2016-05-13 18:29:18 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, yeah i know how that goes, I get worked in multiplayer
[2016-05-13 18:29:38 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] me referia que sabemos que distro de linux usa, de igual forma xbmc es un programa que corre sobre la distro que uses, como gnome, etc
[2016-05-13 18:29:40 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] my accuracy is 30% and I get about 9-12 kills
[2016-05-13 18:29:46 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] my parents took Doom away when i was a kid. my poor dad had to stay up all night learning how to use the "deltree" command in DOS.
[2016-05-13 18:30:26 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Much later, I was over at a friends house, handed a game controller for a skiing game, and died twice within a minute.
[2016-05-13 18:30:37 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] lol
[2016-05-13 18:30:51 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] GabrielGF, y si por alhuna razon no te corre en linux, metele windows xp y metele xbmc para windows, que tambien lo hay
[2016-05-13 18:31:08 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, was it SkiFree?
[2016-05-13 18:31:09 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Genial
[2016-05-13 18:31:35 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] So, I lost interest in video games of that sort. Put me in an arcade with some quarters and a game with a steering wheel, and I can win most of the time.
[2016-05-13 18:31:49 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, I have no clue, it was over 10 years ago.
[2016-05-13 18:31:51 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, was this it? http://ski.ihoc.net/
[2016-05-13 18:32:15 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] No, a little more advanced graphic.
[2016-05-13 18:32:18 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] ah ok
[2016-05-13 18:33:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] tortib: i remember skifree
[2016-05-13 18:33:55 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] yeah, that game was boss
[2016-05-13 18:34:28 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Dagger: interesting.
[2016-05-13 18:34:33 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Tomorrow, I'm shutting my computer down after an unknown amount of time of being up to replace the battery cartridge in my battery backup unit.
[2016-05-13 18:35:04 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And then the cable game begins...
[2016-05-13 18:35:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] cable game?
[2016-05-13 18:35:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] You know, figuring out which cable behind the computer goes to what.
[2016-05-13 18:36:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: kitten will probably be happy to help with that
[2016-05-13 18:36:51 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] There's the various power cables, mouse and keyboard cables, sound system cables, printer cables (to a nonworking printer), USB hub cables, etc etc etc etc etc.
[2016-05-13 18:37:09 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, not when I run the vacuum cleaner under there.
[2016-05-13 18:38:08 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I was gonna say something but I think it's better if I don't
[2016-05-13 18:38:31 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I already have a ton of hate
[2016-05-13 18:39:26 -0500] [ZombieAlive in #debian-es] deb:  Pero si solo vas a usar una distro para cosas básicas no vale la pena usar Gnome o KDE con un monton de servicios cuando puedes ahorrarlos y usar kodi-standalone.
[2016-05-13 18:40:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, is it "family friendly"?
[2016-05-13 18:41:55 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't even know what family friendly is
[2016-05-13 18:41:58 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] El problema es que me baje openelec y no andubo
[2016-05-13 18:42:04 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] so i'll just forget about it
[2016-05-13 18:42:21 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] me hago lio entre las distros y el programa. Kodi es las dos cosas?
[2016-05-13 18:42:27 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-friendly
[2016-05-13 18:43:19 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] Hay estoy probando ubuntu studio que justo lo tenía en el pendrive y en modo live se lo banca. Pero me parece que es mucho de gusto. Mejor dejar recursos libres para que descomprima los videos en tiempo real o lo que sea
[2016-05-13 18:43:27 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] ¿Qué opinan?
[2016-05-13 18:43:36 -0500] [GabrielGF in #debian-es] es la versión 15.10
[2016-05-13 18:44:07 -0500] [voxadam in #debian] When serving files using NFSv4 is it still required/advisable to bind mount directories to a nfs root (e.g. /srv/exports/) before exporting them?
[2016-05-13 18:45:08 -0500] [voxadam in #debian] It's been quite a long time since I've configured an NFS server and I'm trying to be good and follow the best practices.
[2016-05-13 18:46:02 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] x-fak, cannot believe such ram usage
[2016-05-13 18:47:26 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] well thanks for clearing that up
[2016-05-13 18:47:35 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] You're welcome. 8)
[2016-05-13 18:53:41 -0500] [insidious in #debian] How can i change folder permissions in Debian 8 ?
[2016-05-13 18:54:04 -0500] [markybob in #debian] chmod/chown ...like on every *nix
[2016-05-13 18:54:07 -0500] [insidious in #debian] chmod -R 777
[2016-05-13 18:54:09 -0500] [insidious in #debian] this dont work
[2016-05-13 18:54:11 -0500] [insidious in #debian] like ubuntu
[2016-05-13 18:54:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] insidious: then you don't own it
[2016-05-13 18:54:33 -0500] [insidious in #debian] ?
[2016-05-13 18:54:34 -0500] [markybob in #debian] insidious: thus chown
[2016-05-13 18:54:44 -0500] [insidious in #debian] chown
[2016-05-13 18:54:46 -0500] [insidious in #debian] no numbers?
[2016-05-13 18:55:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] chown makes you own it (if you run it as sudo/root). chown userfoo:groupfoo
[2016-05-13 18:55:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] then you can chmod if you need
[2016-05-13 18:55:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] man chown and man chmod for more info
[2016-05-13 18:55:54 -0500] [insidious in #debian] tells me im missing operand
[2016-05-13 18:56:13 -0500] [markybob in #debian] you need to give it the dir name afterwards
[2016-05-13 18:56:26 -0500] [markybob in #debian] man them
[2016-05-13 18:57:18 -0500] [markybob in #debian] otherwise you will have insidious effects :P yes i had to
[2016-05-13 18:57:54 -0500] [insidious in #debian] lol
[2016-05-13 18:59:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] insidious: be really careful doing recursive permission changes, especially if setting to 777
[2016-05-13 19:00:26 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] never set anything to 777..
[2016-05-13 19:00:33 -0500] [insidious in #debian] jmnaught its for wraith
[2016-05-13 19:00:52 -0500] [insidious in #debian] i only do 777 because only way i know how to do it
[2016-05-13 19:01:28 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] what is wraith?
[2016-05-13 19:01:34 -0500] [markybob in #debian] insidious: you should do a google for linux permissions. i'm sure there's a tutorial that's easier than manpages for you to understand
[2016-05-13 19:01:44 -0500] [insidious in #debian] its a botnet to seucre irc channels based on eggdrop
[2016-05-13 19:01:57 -0500] [nevyn in #debian] Dagger: the other thing is using the directory stack stuff.
[2016-05-13 19:01:58 -0500] [insidious in #debian] okay thanks
[2016-05-13 19:01:59 -0500] [nkuttler in #debian] ah yes, running irc stuff with 777, wonderful idea..
[2016-05-13 19:02:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] yeah, that sounds like hell in a handbasket
[2016-05-13 19:02:21 -0500] [insidious in #debian] well
[2016-05-13 19:02:24 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] insidious: read "man chmod" you can also use u+rw,g-rw syntax instead of numbers
[2016-05-13 19:02:26 -0500] [nevyn in #debian] Dagger: man pushd
[2016-05-13 19:02:45 -0500] [insidious in #debian] the bots are encrpted with sha1 salt for the bots
[2016-05-13 19:02:50 -0500] [insidious in #debian] so it wouldnt matter anyway
[2016-05-13 19:03:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no it matters. it matters hard.
[2016-05-13 19:03:08 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] insidious: 777 means "everyone can do anything with this file"
[2016-05-13 19:03:21 -0500] [insidious in #debian] right
[2016-05-13 19:03:29 -0500] [insidious in #debian] they would have to login to the box tho
[2016-05-13 19:03:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] that bot/thing/whatever has a bug...they own it. they can do anything to it
[2016-05-13 19:03:38 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no they don't
[2016-05-13 19:03:49 -0500] [insidious in #debian] really?
[2016-05-13 19:03:55 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] nevyn: `pushd`/`popd` instead of `bash`/ctrl+d, you mean? those are useful, although I tend to rely on `cd -`
[2016-05-13 19:03:59 -0500] [insidious in #debian] what permission should i use?
[2016-05-13 19:04:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] insidious: i'd read the docs it comes with. i'm sure it says
[2016-05-13 19:04:30 -0500] [insidious in #debian] thats the command said to do it on the website for the bot
[2016-05-13 19:04:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jesus
[2016-05-13 19:04:54 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] insidious: generally the best practice is to use the principle of least privilege.. only give just enough permission for it to work properly, nothing more
[2016-05-13 19:05:02 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] nevyn: it's usually more for things like virtualenvs (where you need to import into the current shell) that I do the subshell thing for though
[2016-05-13 19:05:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] if the authors are that stupid stay away
[2016-05-13 19:05:19 -0500] [insidious in #debian] okay im going to look into file permissons to better understand it better
[2016-05-13 19:05:23 -0500] [insidious in #debian] thanks for the help
[2016-05-13 19:05:36 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] insidious: there must be a better bot you can use. supybot is okay, and has a Debian package
[2016-05-13 19:05:51 -0500] [insidious in #debian] okay ill check into it
[2016-05-13 19:05:54 -0500] [insidious in #debian] thanks again mate
[2016-05-13 19:10:02 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] What should I be putting in /etc/network/interfaces if I want to specify a configuration for an interface but not have ifup -a fail if the interface is missing?
[2016-05-13 19:12:40 -0500] [dka in #debian] I have a SSH tunnel : ssha root@myhost.com A -L 8081:ip:8080, I am trying to contact the service using curl http://localhost:8081, it is not working, I need to allow the outgoing packet  through the correct interface. Any help ?
[2016-05-13 19:22:08 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] dka: what's "ip"?
[2016-05-13 19:29:35 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Hey all
[2016-05-13 19:32:52 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Well I improved my accuracy in Doom, from 30% to 46% lol
[2016-05-13 19:33:56 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] that was using rocket launcher only too
[2016-05-13 19:38:12 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] ac1dh0n3ycl0ud: mwahahahaha. check out what I did: http://pastebin.com/raw/x08xjQSN
[2016-05-13 19:38:54 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] not properly tested at all, but source that (with bash-completion loaded), and "/e/n/in<tab>" will complete to "/etc/network/interfaces" :D
[2016-05-13 19:39:09 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] ZombieAlive, ? eso no dijo
[2016-05-13 19:39:16 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] or as far as "/etc/n" if there's ambiguous matches
[2016-05-13 19:39:47 -0500] [ac1dh0n3ycl0ud in #debian] Dagger: Dastardly.
[2016-05-13 19:40:48 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] I really wasn't expecting it to be quite that simple (although it probably won't be once I find all the bugs, but hey)
[2016-05-13 19:41:18 -0500] [deb in #kamaoo] help
[2016-05-13 19:42:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Sounds like a good thing.
[2016-05-13 19:44:22 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] Dagger: and this /e/n/in seems like a good idea to you?
[2016-05-13 19:44:56 -0500] [markybob in #debian] zykotick9: yeah don't even try. we talked about it at length :P
[2016-05-13 19:44:59 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] zykotick9: try it and see
[2016-05-13 19:45:10 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] what's the worst that can happen with this, anyway?
[2016-05-13 19:45:23 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Hey marky
[2016-05-13 19:47:21 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] eh it was fun, people i was with were good and we won the match

[2016-05-13 20:03:16 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] kind of difficult multiplayer wise, but still good
[2016-05-13 20:03:19 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] steam? free demo?
[2016-05-13 20:03:30 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] no, they had a open test last month

[2016-05-13 20:23:32 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] ac1dh0n3ycl0ud: the default is to give the process a SIGHUP when you exit the terminal. if you start it with nohup <someprocess>, it won't receive that SIGHUP. if you disown it, it will be detached from the termial
[2016-05-13 20:23:40 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I've fixed my VM issues by simply deleting the LV and creating it again

[2016-05-13 20:30:09 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] markybob yeah, I forgot that backports can have cherry-picked security patches, is there a channel where I can ask about which tomcat packages I need? I see there is tomcat8, then tomcat8-admin and tomcat8-user.. I have to edit server.xml and tomcat-users.xml, I don't know if just tomcat8 will have both
[2016-05-13 20:31:12 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Devastator: i don't know. i just know what debian has/does/supports. aside from that you're on your own.

[2016-05-13 22:02:59 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] So debian sid does not get security updates in a timely manner?
[2016-05-13 22:03:07 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] I read that on https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/ and am hoping it's out of date :)
[2016-05-13 22:03:57 -0500] [dvs in #debian] nope, it's true
[2016-05-13 22:04:17 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aaronm04: you're asking in the wrong place. but no. testing doesn't. both get support in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net per /topic
[2016-05-13 22:04:40 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] ah ok, thanks
[2016-05-13 22:05:26 -0500] [jercos in #debian] it *may* wind up getting security patches in a timely manner from upstream, if the package is being kept up to date well.
[2016-05-13 22:05:45 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] ah I see
[2016-05-13 22:06:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aaronm04: the real question is why the hell do you want/need security support for testing?
[2016-05-13 22:06:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aaronm04: or sid
[2016-05-13 22:06:08 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] how out of date (compared to upstream) is debian stable?
[2016-05-13 22:06:20 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aaronm04: do you understand what they are for?
[2016-05-13 22:06:33 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] I'm trying to choose between running stable and testing, and I seem to recall that stable had a lot of packages out of date
[2016-05-13 22:06:40 -0500] [markybob in #debian] aaronm04: couple of years. with security backports so it's safe
[2016-05-13 22:06:57 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Whenever I try to install the backported Linux, I get something about sda2 having a bad superblock.
[2016-05-13 22:07:07 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Like, when it's building the initrd.
[2016-05-13 22:07:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] JordiGH: you gave us zero info to work with. so, congrats
[2016-05-13 22:07:46 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] No, bad superblock, initrd, sda2, you got some info.
[2016-05-13 22:08:21 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Not a whole lot,  but I wouldn't say "zero".
[2016-05-13 22:08:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] JordiGH: no. i see nothing
[2016-05-13 22:08:29 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Zero would be like "i have a problem, help".
[2016-05-13 22:08:32 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Open your eyes.
[2016-05-13 22:08:40 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] There are at least three pieces of information.
[2016-05-13 22:08:45 -0500] [markybob in #debian] JordiGH: okay. help yourself
[2016-05-13 22:08:46 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] for example, the device name.
[2016-05-13 22:11:30 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] I can't c&p, but it's reading linux image, found initrd, then three kernel messages about bad superblock on sda2, two aabout invalid media (0xd4) then more kernel messages about no qnx4 filesystem, another about ufs: i didn't specify the type of my ufs filesystem.
[2016-05-13 22:11:49 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] then what looks like a usage message about mount
[2016-05-13 22:12:08 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] And finally a warning about how the wrong ufstype may corrupt my filesystem.
[2016-05-13 22:12:18 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] All of these things are kernel messages at the end.
[2016-05-13 22:12:18 -0500] [markybob in #debian] without exact things i don't know how you want us to help
[2016-05-13 22:12:33 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] You're quite unwilling to help, don't even try.
[2016-05-13 22:12:37 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] I'm not talking to you.
[2016-05-13 22:12:39 -0500] [markybob in #debian] hell you can take a screenshot with your cellphone
[2016-05-13 22:12:45 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] I don't own a phone.
[2016-05-13 22:13:12 -0500] [markybob in #debian] write it on a piece of paper and go to paste.debian.net
[2016-05-13 22:13:14 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Anyone know how I can change my alpine directory? Where would the config be, or is there a command I can use?
[2016-05-13 22:13:16 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] Then initramfs says "done", after those kernel message.s
[2016-05-13 22:13:31 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] markybob: You really are not gonna get a lot more info from the exact messages.
[2016-05-13 22:13:49 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] bad superblock, 0xd4, then more mumbo jumbo, then mkinitfs says 'done'
[2016-05-13 22:14:04 -0500] [JordiGH in #debian] What I don't even get is, wtf is sda2? I don't actually have an sda2 device.
[2016-05-13 22:14:32 -0500] [markybob in #debian] NoCode: probably -a? https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_setup_scripts

[2016-05-13 22:17:00 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] I guess I could also change the default mail directories Debian is configured to. But I dunno
[2016-05-13 22:18:16 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Well, not Googling I guess. I should use *Google* if I need result-based results.

[2016-05-13 22:19:37 -0500] [awwal in #debian] JordiGH, when getting that error message,  ctrl+s for pause the output works?

[2016-05-13 23:34:35 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena,  yep perlmonks said "User since: 	Apr 25, 2002 at 08:28 UTC " ...now  am believer
[2016-05-13 23:35:25 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, the only problem I've encountered is trying to use Lady Aleena on Facebook and Google+. Damn them!
[2016-05-13 23:35:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: Firefly is why I got into Buffy. I'm also enjoying Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (but i'm a big nerd when it comes to superheroes)
[2016-05-13 23:36:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, watching the Arrowverse (including Supergil and Constantine now)?
[2016-05-13 23:36:55 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] is still bummed after the last episode of Legends of Tomorrow.
[2016-05-13 23:38:02 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: i watched all of Constantine (and have read all of Hellblazer up to about 2009), but otherwise the DC television stuff hasn't been very interesting for me. Daredevil and Jessica Jones on the other hand, top shelf stuff right there
[2016-05-13 23:38:23 -0500] [aindilis` in #debian] hi
[2016-05-13 23:38:37 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] If any of y'all feel like trying to break something, I wrote an IRC bot that probably has security vulnerabilities
[2016-05-13 23:38:44 -0500] [LambdaComplex in #debian] spldart: what if you use ''mount -a'' ?
[2016-05-13 23:38:52 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught, seems http://paste.debian.net/683830/ two sets of error first from output of chrome the other output of ssh
[2016-05-13 23:38:53 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] https://github.com/pharpend/desbot#usage
[2016-05-13 23:39:26 -0500] [spldart in #debian] Yeah. Tried that. Mount -a LL just gets me the extra drives showing up with weird partitions
[2016-05-13 23:39:58 -0500] [LambdaComplex in #debian] Are you using the word "drives" when you mean partitions? Just wondering
[2016-05-13 23:40:18 -0500] [spldart in #debian] But! If I mount each drive after that manually as superuser in terminal then all is fine...
[2016-05-13 23:40:29 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught, and the third is being reported by clearlinux http://paste.debian.net/683831/ (top of this post)
[2016-05-13 23:40:35 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] you can private-message desbot_
[2016-05-13 23:40:47 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I was logging on as desbot too much and freenode banned me
[2016-05-13 23:40:53 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] temporarily, supposedly
[2016-05-13 23:40:58 -0500] [spldart in #debian] So 16 mount on boot. Then the last 4 I mount after.. Otherwise I go straight to recovery mode with some drives showing as weird partitions
[2016-05-13 23:40:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, before I give any more recommendations, I need to know your sci-fi/fantasy leanings, spaceships or magic?
[2016-05-13 23:41:17 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] oh apparently it's allowed again
[2016-05-13 23:41:24 -0500] [spldart in #debian] yes... each drive = partition
[2016-05-13 23:41:29 -0500] [spldart in #debian] one partition per drive
[2016-05-13 23:41:32 -0500] [spldart in #debian] sorry
[2016-05-13 23:41:45 -0500] [LambdaComplex in #debian] Are you sure the fstab entries are correct?
[2016-05-13 23:42:09 -0500] [spldart in #debian] I have every drive formatted in ext4. Only one partition per drive.
[2016-05-13 23:42:25 -0500] [spldart in #debian] If I drop some drives from the hardware others then work using fstab
[2016-05-13 23:42:43 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] Provided you live somewhere where postage isn't obscene, I'll mail you US $5 if you manage to break desbot
[2016-05-13 23:42:48 -0500] [spldart in #debian] but I cannot get fstab to automagicly mount all 20 drives
[2016-05-13 23:42:59 -0500] [aindilis` in #debian-offtopic] hi
[2016-05-13 23:43:05 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] hi aindilis`
[2016-05-13 23:43:24 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: seems like you're having two separate problems. SSH and TLS/https use two different sets of unrelated certificates. For the ssh command, what is the actual error you get when it's not in verbose mode?
[2016-05-13 23:44:12 -0500] [spldart in #debian] right now I'm running uber simple fstab..... ex: /dev/sdr1 /home/user/Datas/data18 defaults
[2016-05-13 23:44:19 -0500] [aindilis` in #debian-offtopic] hi pharpend
[2016-05-13 23:44:21 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught, just one second it takes 3 minutes before the error shows up
[2016-05-13 23:44:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: more space and robots than magic but i like both. A friend got me into Shadowrun recently which doesn't have spaceships but does have a cool mix of scifi and fantasy
[2016-05-13 23:45:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I can get behind Stargate SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis (though not Stargate Universe) and the original V (not the ABC remake) for spaceshipy sci-fi.
[2016-05-13 23:45:53 -0500] [spldart in #debian] ... I can disconnect a random drive and the problem shifts on drive letter designation. If I remove any several then debian boots normal and then I can manually mount the rest in terminal
[2016-05-13 23:46:09 -0500] [spldart in #debian] s/on/one
[2016-05-13 23:46:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I'm not up on too much more science fiction than that. Most science fiction these days are so rooted on terra firma, I blank out on them. So I would need to see what is currently listed on my recommendations to see if there is anything new to add to it.
[2016-05-13 23:46:52 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught,  ssh -p 10022 root@localhost ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
[2016-05-13 23:47:22 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, new meaning missing from my recommendations.
[2016-05-13 23:47:29 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] pharpend, Haskell? how buggy it is?
[2016-05-13 23:47:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: i'll check out the original V. I watched some of the remake and the concept was interesting but seemed poorly executed
[2016-05-13 23:48:00 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: have you see The 100?
[2016-05-13 23:48:33 -0500] [spldart in #debian] I was trying for the magic /dev/sdaa1 (double letters) but there seems to be a software limit after Promise tech got me past the hardware limit. (free up irq's for the controllers)
[2016-05-13 23:48:33 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, the 2 original V miniseries are great, but you can see the budget cuts in the short lived TV series.
[2016-05-13 23:49:04 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I looked at the description and I don't want teen angst at the moment. If I want angst I'll rewatch Buffy and Angel.
[2016-05-13 23:49:04 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] deb: It's written in Haskell. If you PM desbot_ it will evaluate whatever you send it
[2016-05-13 23:49:58 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] deb: I would do the Don Knuth thing and send $2.56 or $5.12, but I don't have any pennies
[2016-05-13 23:50:28 -0500] [LambdaComplex in #debian] spldart: ...are you just doing this to hit sdaa?
[2016-05-13 23:50:28 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: oh, so you have a shell on the server and cannot even connect to localhost? Does the same happen if you try connecting as a user other than root? Any recent changes to sshd_config?
[2016-05-13 23:50:38 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Most television series these days are so serial, it is very hard for me to get into them. I grew up on the problem-of-the-week TV where one could miss an episode or three and not miss much.
[2016-05-13 23:51:07 -0500] [spldart in #debian] why yes. Yes I am Mr. LamdaComplex. It was a challenge I wanted to poke a stick at.
[2016-05-13 23:51:33 -0500] [LambdaComplex in #debian] That's beautiful
[2016-05-13 23:51:48 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] yes happens then too ( I would like to just --purge and reinstall these sub systems, at the moment I am having a trust issue with my debian install (maybe a complete wipe and reinstall is in order?) (this would be a lot of work though)
[2016-05-13 23:51:53 -0500] [spldart in #debian] sry... More detail. Old tyan mobo, lots of promise tx2000's, and a ton of pata hdds
[2016-05-13 23:52:29 -0500] [spldart in #debian] And I felt even more encouraged after Promise offered assistance towards the hardware limitations on there support BB
[2016-05-13 23:52:39 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] heh.. i love serial stuff. Babylon 5 is one my all time favourites because of the story that takes place across the whole 5 seasons
[2016-05-13 23:52:41 -0500] [spldart in #debian] Two irq
[2016-05-13 23:52:48 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I'm tired of watching an episode of a television series and see nothing accomplished.
[2016-05-13 23:53:17 -0500] [spldart in #debian] sry. Two irq's per promise card necessary. So I shut down all the unecessary stuff to have plenty available
[2016-05-13 23:53:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I could have gone without season 5 of Babylon 5.
[2016-05-13 23:53:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: if you connect with ssh to the server from a computer that's connected before, does it give warnings about keys mismatched?
[2016-05-13 23:54:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, it is too bad there wasn't enough money put behind Crusade to keep it going.
[2016-05-13 23:54:26 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] let me see if i can figure that out (I might not have another local system to try but hold on
[2016-05-13 23:54:35 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, not one single picture of you in your google links!
[2016-05-13 23:54:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: ssh uses a Trust On First Use (TOFU) trust model, were the first time you connect to a server it saves its host certificate in ~/.ssh/known_hosts, and if the server's cert ever doesn't match your SSH client will complain very loudly
[2016-05-13 23:54:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, link?
[2016-05-13 23:54:54 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] google search
[2016-05-13 23:55:09 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, no me.
[2016-05-13 23:55:21 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] good
[2016-05-13 23:55:47 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: it's true. they compressed too much into season 4 because they thought they'd be cancelled. which probably made season 4 all the better. season 5 should have had a war with the psi-corps
[2016-05-13 23:55:52 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] thats the way i am, you never find anything from my family or me in the interwebs
[2016-05-13 23:55:59 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] ah ok well in that case I cant test it cause I did a purge of ssh-server and reinstall and wipe of ~/.ssh to get rid of this issue (same results locally) as far as remote servers I am going to try but its from scratch
[2016-05-13 23:56:00 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, the only images in the image search for Lady Aleena I've ever put up is the avatar with the blond hair.
[2016-05-13 23:56:33 -0500] [spldart in #debian] Anyone here have any experience in the 17 + hdd range in debian? 16 seems to be a limit for fstab and I can get to 20 drives manually mounting thereafter.
[2016-05-13 23:56:37 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] images.google shows a lot, but not sure which are yours
[2016-05-13 23:56:38 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] the ssl output error from chrome is very troubling too.. which indicates a problem with root certificates
[2016-05-13 23:56:58 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, have you ever watched seaQuest?
[2016-05-13 23:56:59 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: okay, well next time this is one of your first lines of defense.
[2016-05-13 23:57:07 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, only the blond haired avatar.
[2016-05-13 23:57:27 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] smartgirl
[2016-05-13 23:57:38 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] can I mix an ssd and non ssd drives in an lvm?
[2016-05-13 23:57:45 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] "what is the first line of defense?"
[2016-05-13 23:57:47 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, you saw her on my PerlMonks node.
[2016-05-13 23:57:50 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] does that defeat the point of my ssd's speed?
[2016-05-13 23:57:58 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] yes and probably
[2016-05-13 23:58:04 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] actually it is in your twitter, etc
[2016-05-13 23:58:11 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] though you can create lvs on specific drives in a group
[2016-05-13 23:58:16 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: so.. i don't use chrome but it seems more like a handshake failure breakdown in communication between client and server.. are you getting invalid certificate errors in browser?
[2016-05-13 23:58:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, I use her where ever I can.
[2016-05-13 23:58:22 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] you may be better off creating two lgs
[2016-05-13 23:58:32 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I can???
[2016-05-13 23:58:34 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] dammit
[2016-05-13 23:58:36 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] thats good, lots of pervs here xD
[2016-05-13 23:58:41 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] ugh
[2016-05-13 23:58:42 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] :)
[2016-05-13 23:58:58 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] how do I remove the non ssd from the lg?
[2016-05-13 23:59:01 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] no I am not getting invalid certifcates in browser (this was discovered by accident ) I ran chrome from the command line and thats where its outputed
[2016-05-13 23:59:05 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: "first line of defense" as in ssh client will complain loudly if it gets the wrong ssh host certificate for a server it has previously connected to. You lose that if you delete ~/.ssh and purge the server
[2016-05-13 23:59:08 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: see the 2nd arg in lvcreate
[2016-05-13 23:59:20 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: otherwise the site loads fine?
[2016-05-13 23:59:20 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, oh there is a fake account with Lady Aleena on it on Twitter which annoys the hell out of me.
[2016-05-13 23:59:25 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] yes
[2016-05-13 23:59:38 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] I am worried about man in middle attacks
[2016-05-13 23:59:41 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: that's more difficult. you'll need to resize the lg so that it no longer uses the drive you want first, I think. I've never performed this.
[2016-05-13 23:59:47 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: no
[2016-05-14 00:00:08 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: actually
[2016-05-14 00:00:11 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: see vgreduce
[2016-05-14 00:00:49 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] deb, it uses Lady Aleena and my avatar. I have 12 twitter accounts (11 of which are going no where since my scripts broke). There is also a ladyaleena who is her own person, but the one with Lady Aleena and my avatar which is not mine make so angry.
[2016-05-14 00:00:56 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: I've heard that Outlander is good, and it's developed by Ronald D. Moore (who did the Battlestar Galactica remake)
[2016-05-14 00:01:14 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] xD
[2016-05-14 00:01:17 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] I run a lot of web servers, and things
[2016-05-14 00:01:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, seaQest is a good series if you can forgive some of season 2.
[2016-05-14 00:01:49 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] yes aypea[1]
[2016-05-14 00:01:52 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] that's what I was just now doing
[2016-05-14 00:01:58 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] not sure why the disk is still in use
[2016-05-14 00:02:01 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, season 2 of seaQuest went off the rails more than a little bit, but I got through it.
[2016-05-14 00:02:19 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] ahh cronjob just run! i got todays word-clouds! this is #debian-offtopic's xD https://ptpb.pw/0R8R.png
[2016-05-14 00:02:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: well i don't know what's happening there. i would assume if the site loads okay in chrome that those errors happen but then it simply retries. Have you tested the site in firefox/iceweasel or with ssllabs.com, or gnutls-cli or openssl s_client?
[2016-05-14 00:02:39 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, so it is a future ship which is under water instead of in space.
[2016-05-14 00:03:14 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] no with ssllabs.com is it just going there and seeing it loads ok?
[2016-05-14 00:03:23 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I don't know anything about Outlander.
[2016-05-14 00:04:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, oh guh! Time travel...hardly ever done right.
[2016-05-14 00:04:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_%28TV_series%29 it looks good, but i haven't watched it yet
[2016-05-14 00:04:25 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: heh. I run my lv on md so I've never ever had to deal with this
[2016-05-14 00:04:28 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I got there a second before your link. 8)
[2016-05-14 00:04:39 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] DammitJim: does pvdisplay give useful info?
[2016-05-14 00:04:46 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: it performs a bunch of tests, there's a checkbox to keep the results private
[2016-05-14 00:04:57 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] my web servers test ok , just seems confined to my desktop
[2016-05-14 00:05:42 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] oh wait its doing more tests thought it was finished
[2016-05-14 00:06:05 -0500] [spldart in #debian] Well.. Poop.
[2016-05-14 00:06:46 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: it will give your site a score. ideally you want an A or higher
[2016-05-14 00:07:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] really looking forward to Captain America: Civil War
[2016-05-14 00:07:44 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] lowest score a 90 highest 100
[2016-05-14 00:08:19 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] keyexchange and cipher strength are the lowest
[2016-05-14 00:08:27 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] I can probably fix that
[2016-05-14 00:08:32 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] aypea[1], did you mean vgreduce or pvreduce?
[2016-05-14 00:08:50 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/  <-- very useful
[2016-05-14 00:09:03 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] as far as my desktop (to be safe I think I am reinstalling debian) besides md5 of the disk is there anything else I can do ?
[2016-05-14 00:09:18 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] its already in sitcam, i just watched in kodi
[2016-05-14 00:09:28 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] resolution sucks dho
[2016-05-14 00:10:17 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] that site you just gaves indicates Modern intermediate an old ( which is better intermediate or modern?)
[2016-05-14 00:10:31 -0500] [television in #debian-offtopic] butt
[2016-05-14 00:10:34 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] s/an/and
[2016-05-14 00:10:59 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: it depends on if you need to support people with older browsers or not
[2016-05-14 00:11:20 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] ah ok I assume intermediate is more compatible?
[2016-05-14 00:11:25 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: you can also run "gnutls-cli fqdn.example.com" to see if there are problems
[2016-05-14 00:11:31 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, also, if you want an alternate vampire series, you could watch Blood Ties.
[2016-05-14 00:12:03 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] ok, thanks for that info, on my question about the debian cd is the MD5 the best guarantees?
[2016-05-14 00:12:18 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I vant to suk ur blood!
[2016-05-14 00:12:22 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: that mozilla site will change the "oldest compatible clients" line for old, intermediate, modern
[2016-05-14 00:12:28 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] bleh
[2016-05-14 00:12:33 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: there's a debsums package that you could use
[2016-05-14 00:12:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i might be a little burnt out on vampires for now
[2016-05-14 00:13:16 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] ok I will look into that ( I assume thats a certificate for each of the files in the install or something?)
[2016-05-14 00:13:17 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, also if you watched Warehouse 13, you might want to watch The Dresden Files to see an actor from W13 playing a vampire in a few episodes.
[2016-05-14 00:15:39 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught, thanks for the help, I will reinstall desktop ( I will probably use a minimal server install and just build a desktop on top of that)
[2016-05-14 00:15:40 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: most but not all debian packages have hash sums for all their files, this is what debsums checks
[2016-05-14 00:15:54 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] thanks a lot
[2016-05-14 00:16:04 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I haven't watched TV in so long that I have never heard of these sitcoms or whatever they are.
[2016-05-14 00:16:04 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: that might not be necessary, i would look for more errors before going nuclear like that
[2016-05-14 00:16:24 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] ok I will
[2016-05-14 00:18:06 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: Jessica Jones is really excellent if you like film noir and strong female anti-heroes. she's sort of a reluctant superhero (no costume)
[2016-05-14 00:18:15 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] it's a little dark
[2016-05-14 00:21:50 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: There's a TV series?
[2016-05-14 00:21:55 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] has only read the books
[2016-05-14 00:24:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] transhuman_: i would say that if firefox/iceweasel and gnutls-cli don't complain about bad certificates that your system is probably fine, and would suggest looking into chrome/chromium bugs
[2016-05-14 00:25:12 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] woohoo
[2016-05-14 00:25:13 -0500] [transhuman_ in #debian] jmcnaught, thanks I will look at that before I do anything
[2016-05-14 00:27:13 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, they are science fiction/fantasy series.
[2016-05-14 00:27:41 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, maybe during the spring/summer hiatus of the current series I am watching.
[2016-05-14 00:28:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jarick, it was short lived and starred Paul Blackthrone as Dresden.
[2016-05-14 00:28:36 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jarick, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files_%28TV_series%29
[2016-05-14 00:29:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jarick, unless you are talking about Blood Ties, then yes also, it lasted a little longer than Dresden...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Ties_%28TV_series%29
[2016-05-14 00:29:50 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] wooo
[2016-05-14 00:29:55 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Had a Kill/Death Ratio of 1.0
[2016-05-14 00:30:02 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] 37% accuracy
[2016-05-14 00:31:24 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] tortib: are the melee attacks as fun as they look in the videos i watched?
[2016-05-14 00:31:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, also, if you've seen Warehouse 13 and want something else like it, you could give The Librarians a try (watch the 3 TV films first, then the series).
[2016-05-14 00:32:31 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i think i only watched the first episode of Warehouse 13 and didn't get into it
[2016-05-14 00:32:37 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] having problems with utf8 characters displaying as boxes with small characters in ssh'ing from debian to raspbian, problem not evident on fedora, any gotchas with ssh and locales I'm missing?
[2016-05-14 00:32:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, and if you want something like Warehouse 13 and The Librarians but predates both, you could watch Friday the 13th: The Series.
[2016-05-14 00:33:38 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Friday the 13th: The Series makes The Librarian(s) and Warehouse 13 look absolutely childish in comparison.
[2016-05-14 00:33:58 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] If you like Stephen King, you could give Haven a shot.
[2016-05-14 00:34:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bagbobilgins: what terminal emulator are you using? in gnome-terminal for example check that character encoding is set to UTF-8 (under the terminal menu).
[2016-05-14 00:35:07 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] terminator, set to utf-8
[2016-05-14 00:35:20 -0500] [jarick in #debian-offtopic] idly wonders what Dollhouse maps to
[2016-05-14 00:35:55 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: oh i did like the first season of Haven and then forgot about it. apparently there are five seasons.
[2016-05-14 00:36:04 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: have you seen Orphan Black?
[2016-05-14 00:36:29 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, and the 4 seasons of Haven are so intense! Good guh are they intense.
[2016-05-14 00:36:41 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I don't like clones. Sorry.
[2016-05-14 00:36:52 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, it doesn't do it all the time
[2016-05-14 00:36:57 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] but yes they are
[2016-05-14 00:37:00 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] also happening in gnome-terminal and xfce-terminal, both set to utf-8
[2016-05-14 00:37:14 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] they have to be low HP for you to do that
[2016-05-14 00:37:44 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, if you want back into space, there is Andromeda and Farscape too.
[2016-05-14 00:37:52 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: i thought Tatiana Maslany was pretty awesome as so many versions of herself
[2016-05-14 00:38:08 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] I was surprised by how much i liked Farscape
[2016-05-14 00:38:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I saw the synopsis of Orphan Black and gave it a pass.
[2016-05-14 00:38:36 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bagbobilgins: what do you get for "echo $LANG"?
[2016-05-14 00:38:58 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, you are making me really stretch my mind here on all the science fiction/fantasy I've watched over the years.
[2016-05-14 00:39:05 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] the characters are all pretty compelling
[2016-05-14 00:39:35 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] heh, well i don't want to wear you out, you've given me some pretty solid recommendations so far
[2016-05-14 00:40:14 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] jmcnaught: en_GB.UTF-8
[2016-05-14 00:40:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, GUH! Some of these are so old and not out on DVD nor will they ever make it to DVD, so I can't suggest them.
[2016-05-14 00:41:03 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] face palms.
[2016-05-14 00:41:07 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] on the raspbian I'm ssh'ing to and the debian I am ssh'ing from
[2016-05-14 00:41:23 -0500] [DHowett in #debian] hmm
[2016-05-14 00:41:24 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bagbobilgins: okay it must be a font issue then
[2016-05-14 00:41:26 -0500] [DHowett in #debian] it could be a font missing those codepoints
[2016-05-14 00:42:00 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] ahh, I did read about a package that perhaps "fleshes out" some fonts?
[2016-05-14 00:42:26 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, if you like alien invasions of Earth, you can watch War of the World (TV series) or Earth: Final Conflict (posthumously by Gene Roddenberry).
[2016-05-14 00:42:31 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] tried quite a few, will look back at what I'd been reading
[2016-05-14 00:43:04 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] bagbobilgins: i also use terminator, and for me it's set to use the system fixed width font, which according to gnome tweak-tool is droid sans mono regular
[2016-05-14 00:43:53 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, and there is always Ash vs. Evil Dead.
[2016-05-14 00:44:04 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] oh yeah, i've been meaning to watch that
[2016-05-14 00:44:56 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, Ash vs. Evil Dead can be binged in an evening (start around 4pm on a Saturday [or other day off] and go through the night).
[2016-05-14 00:47:00 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, and if you want sword battles in a (near) contemporary setting, there is always Highlander: The Series (with the lesser known spin-off Highlander: The Raven).
[2016-05-14 00:47:55 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, if you want time travel (from a British network which is not tied to Doctor Who) you can watch Primeval (if you can find it).
[2016-05-14 00:49:00 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, for more mutants (which are not X-Men), there is Painkiller Jane and Sanctuary.
[2016-05-14 00:49:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, and for something completely off, there is Tremors: The Series which follows Tremors 3 and is followed by Tremors 5 with Tremors 4 as a prequel to all of it.
[2016-05-14 00:50:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] makes a list.
[2016-05-14 00:50:41 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, just tell me if I'm going too fast.
[2016-05-14 00:51:03 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: have you seen The Prisoner? (the original, not the remake)
[2016-05-14 00:51:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, no I have not. I really should some day.
[2016-05-14 00:52:21 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] it's very good and has a very strange ending. Patrick McGoohan was pretty much run out of the UK because people didn't get it. (I didn't get it, but still enjoyed it)
[2016-05-14 00:52:32 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, you've probably seen The X-Files, but have you seen Millennium or The Lone Gunmen?
[2016-05-14 00:52:55 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] nope
[2016-05-14 00:54:01 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, recommended (the former more than the latter).
[2016-05-14 00:54:56 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, are you a geek enough to have seen the entire Star Trek franchise?
[2016-05-14 00:56:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] different kind of geek i guess. i've seen lots of Star Trek but not all of it
[2016-05-14 00:56:39 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, there is also the post-apocalyptic Jericho (not much sci-fi, but still applicable to the genre).
[2016-05-14 00:56:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i've read all of Spider-Man up to the mid 90s though
[2016-05-14 00:58:29 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] There is also the non-Disney fairy tale miniseries The 10th Kingdom (5 parts about 90 mins. each).
[2016-05-14 00:58:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: i do like post-apocalyptic but didn't get into Jericho. Two books in that genre I can recommend though are The Long Tomorrow by Leigh Brackett (she also wrote the script for Empire Strikes Back), and A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller
[2016-05-14 00:59:30 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I'm reaching the end of my suggestions. I digging deep here. 8)
[2016-05-14 00:59:52 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: well thank you, you've given me quite the list :)
[2016-05-14 01:01:02 -0500] [f3rG44 in #debian-offtopic] so fucking good was House MD. there was no equal series in the future i guess.
[2016-05-14 01:01:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I think that will be the end of it for now. Most of the other series I would recommend are not out on DVD so not streamable anywhere as far as I know.
[2016-05-14 01:01:50 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, how many series was that by the way?
[2016-05-14 01:02:16 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: heh i'm not sure, by "list" i really meant "transcript"
[2016-05-14 01:02:35 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] laughs. # jmcnaught 
[2016-05-14 01:03:34 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, probably enough to make you a couch potato or worse you'll become one with the couch. 8)
[2016-05-14 01:04:16 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] there is way too much out there to watch it all
[2016-05-14 01:04:49 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I've watched almost all I've recommended.
[2016-05-14 01:05:19 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, though I watched them when they actually aired (and feeling so old right now).
[2016-05-14 01:06:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: I bet you would like The Sandman (a comic book, but not in the superhero genre)
[2016-05-14 01:07:34 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I watched all of Star Trek: TNG, DS9, VOY, and Enterprise when they aired along with seaQuest (and Earth2 while it was on since it was right after seaQuest), most of Stargate SG-1 (when it moved to SyFy) and Atlantis; Eureka, Warehouse 13, and Alphas; and so much more.
[2016-05-14 01:08:03 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I'm a freak, I think.
[2016-05-14 01:08:29 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] meh.. i've watched way too much tv than i'm comfortable to admit
[2016-05-14 01:09:09 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, so have I (since we're only talking sci-fi and fantasy, I've not gotten into all the police procedurals I've seen over the years).
[2016-05-14 01:09:39 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] heh, i'm also a sucker for police procedurals and i don't even like cops
[2016-05-14 01:09:57 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] The Wire is one of the best shows ever
[2016-05-14 01:10:53 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Whew! How can my brain hurt so much from a discussion I am loving?
[2016-05-14 01:11:50 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And I haven't even cleaned up the kitchen from dinner yet, and I need to do so soon.
[2016-05-14 01:11:57 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] did you watch True Detective? season one was really good, i haven't seen the second one yet
[2016-05-14 01:12:30 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I haven't seen either series, though I've heard of The Wire. (I also sort of study crossovers.)
[2016-05-14 01:14:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] crossovers between shows?
[2016-05-14 01:14:06 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I know about more television series than I've seen through my research of crossovers.
[2016-05-14 01:14:12 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Yes crossovers between series.
[2016-05-14 01:14:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And not only between television series, but films as well. (Some films have crossed over with TV series and vice versa.)
[2016-05-14 01:15:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] the Marvel Cinematic Universe is pretty rich with crossovers (the source material even more so)
[2016-05-14 01:15:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, if you want to see my crossover madness, start here: http://fantasy.xecu.net/Movies/Crossovers/index.pl
[2016-05-14 01:16:52 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Jessica Jones for example has a shared universe with Daredevil, and a supporting character Luke Cage is getting his own show, and there will be a team-up series The Defenders, and there are references sprinkled around to the events in the films
[2016-05-14 01:17:12 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, aren't those all part of the Marvel Universe?
[2016-05-14 01:17:19 -0500] [madprops in #debian] is it a bad idea to go from stable to unstable?
[2016-05-14 01:17:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] yeah
[2016-05-14 01:17:24 -0500] [madprops in #debian] i read i should change to testing first
[2016-05-14 01:18:33 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I'd love your thoughts on my crossover work, if you are of a mind to give it a good look, though I understand if you are not interested. I do have to go afk for about 15 or so minutes to clean up the kitchen. Will you still be here then?
[2016-05-14 01:18:42 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] the marvel films too keep hinting about the power gems, leading towards the infinity war films that will (should) have a bunch of characters from all the films
[2016-05-14 01:20:17 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, my writing style does leave something to be desired, but I tried to keep it a bit dry.
[2016-05-14 01:21:25 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] So, I'll be back soon.
[2016-05-14 01:21:57 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] madprops: Its not a bad idea, though it is safer to jump though testing first (main reason is at least in testing everyting should be installable)

[2016-05-14 01:27:31 -0500] [madprops in #debian] usually how far behind is testing from unstable?

[2016-05-14 01:40:07 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] jmcnaught: thanks for your help, apt install unifont seems to have largely fixed it
[2016-05-14 01:40:28 -0500] [bagbobilgins in #debian] DHowett: your tip was exceptionally useful, too
[2016-05-14 01:43:36 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I'm back and will go watch the video now.
[2016-05-14 01:50:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: i'm back to watching Angel. What I don't like about the series right now is how he falls in love with Cordelia. His character should know better than to get romantic with anyone. Also it doesn't seem like anyone's really explained to Connor the whole story, but maybe that's implied
[2016-05-14 01:51:40 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, He's been in love with Cordelia since season 1, he just didn't know it yet.
[2016-05-14 01:54:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] well that guy needs to accept loneliness considering what the stakes are
[2016-05-14 01:58:04 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, I'm biting my tongue metaphorically right now.
[2016-05-14 01:58:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: well i'm sure i'll find out what happens soon enough
[2016-05-14 01:59:10 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, you will, but if you are in season 4, remember, it will be bleak.
[2016-05-14 01:59:52 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] that's fine with me, i'm usually disappointed by happy endings
[2016-05-14 02:04:16 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, then you'll be fine with Angel.
[2016-05-14 02:09:01 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] good morning
[2016-05-14 02:09:15 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, hello.
[2016-05-14 02:13:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, mm... maybe i should say now ... it's me ... ;)
[2016-05-14 02:15:59 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, okeydokey...I'm not much of a conversationalist at the moment. My brain is frying.
[2016-05-14 02:17:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, ah ok, i ment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A

[2016-05-14 02:17:45 -0500] [lok in #debian] need some help; i am on windows; need to learn either linux/debian/bash/ubuntu kind of stuff. how to start? i have 32gb pen drive'; is there any portable version i have to download from any website? please suggest.
[2016-05-14 02:17:48 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, oh, okay. I've never listened to her.
[2016-05-14 02:18:51 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] Hi lok first install some virtualization software like virtualbox or hyper-v if you are on win 8 or 10
[2016-05-14 02:19:03 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] i prefer virtualbox
[2016-05-14 02:19:18 -0500] [lok in #debian] i dont have my own computer cypher_
[2016-05-14 02:19:32 -0500] [lok in #debian] i am on publich PC always cypher_ please consider that situation also
[2016-05-14 02:20:08 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] well then there is option of live cd...
[2016-05-14 02:20:24 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] I'd recommend an actual install but you'll probably need two flash drives to make it easy..
[2016-05-14 02:20:30 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] but really idk how much you can learn that way
[2016-05-14 02:20:36 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, the only way to get me to listen to new music is to put it in a film or TV series I watch and hope I like it. I don't listen to the radio anymore.
[2016-05-14 02:20:42 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] It'll work but it'll be slow..
[2016-05-14 02:21:01 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] If you can probably install the lxde version to it, less packages
[2016-05-14 02:21:30 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, oh, i am running on music. Specially when coding, or actually all day most of the time.
[2016-05-14 02:21:44 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And usually the music is at least 1-2 years old by that time. I got fed up with the music industry when they gave contracts to contest winners who only sang cover songs.
[2016-05-14 02:22:02 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] renting virtual machine on digitalocean would be better to learn commandline etc. you would connect using ssh from any machine and have persistent environment
[2016-05-14 02:22:03 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, true
[2016-05-14 02:22:56 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] but still its hard to learn anything about IT in general without own computer
[2016-05-14 02:22:58 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, but every now and then, some nice thing pops up. But it is not often.
[2016-05-14 02:23:43 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] is there really no option for you to get your own computing platform? raspberry pi, old laptop etc.?
[2016-05-14 02:23:47 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Now if there were a contest show where the musicians had to write their own music and perform it live (bringing with them all the instruments and instrumentalists they need), then maybe I would pay attention.
[2016-05-14 02:24:20 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] why not get a shell account to learn some linux command line?
[2016-05-14 02:24:28 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] But those who sing covers almost karaoke style don't interest me at all.
[2016-05-14 02:24:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I want bands, not just singers.
[2016-05-14 02:24:58 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] i suppose you could learn scripting with bash/zsh sed awk grep etc. that way
[2016-05-14 02:25:01 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, i agree on the old music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5jI9I03q8E

[2016-05-14 02:25:35 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] google free unix shell
[2016-05-14 02:25:47 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] theres one in germany
[2016-05-14 02:25:54 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] thats linux based
[2016-05-14 02:25:58 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, I'm currently listening to Simple Minds.
[2016-05-14 02:26:00 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] sdf.org is good
[2016-05-14 02:26:29 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] in that situation it makes no difference if its linux/freebsd/openbsd/ehatevernix
[2016-05-14 02:26:42 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] shell is still mostly the same
[2016-05-14 02:26:47 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, hard to beat those, true
[2016-05-14 02:26:56 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Honestly, if a 5'2" African-American man were to walk on stage, he'd probably get laughed off of it.

[2016-05-14 02:28:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, nice find :)
[2016-05-14 02:28:11 -0500] [lok in #debian] Wonderscript: why two pen drives?
[2016-05-14 02:28:23 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And none of these singers have to perform in bars filled with the smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke hoping not to have a beer bottle thrown at them.
[2016-05-14 02:28:26 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] One to hold your installation image and the other to install the operating system too..
[2016-05-14 02:28:47 -0500] [lok in #debian] lxde is portable version? can i put it on usb thumb drvive?
[2016-05-14 02:28:57 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] LXDE is a desktop environment.
[2016-05-14 02:28:59 -0500] [lok in #debian] i am looking for portable version only as i guess it may server my needs
[2016-05-14 02:29:11 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] Any linux iso is portable..
[2016-05-14 02:29:26 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] None of the women would be approached by a sleazy bar manager wanting sexual favors for stage time.
[2016-05-14 02:29:30 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] You just install it to a flash drive. Now whether or not it works well is a different story
[2016-05-14 02:29:33 -0500] [lok in #debian] cypher_: renting machine; i guess cant affod when i dont ahve any plan to earn from this learning
[2016-05-14 02:29:43 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: i learned recently from the "What Happened, Miss Simone?" documentary that she was *really* angry at that concert, like incite violent revolution angry
[2016-05-14 02:29:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] she's a very interesting person
[2016-05-14 02:30:15 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, yup, still waiting for the movie to arrive in the cinema's in europe
[2016-05-14 02:30:33 -0500] [lok in #debian] is there any free virtual machine? & moreover there is very less internet speed so i think it ll not be helpful to connect to remote machine thru internet & learn that way? douou think is it feasible on 2g/3g connection speed?
[2016-05-14 02:30:47 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, definitely gone attend to that one
[2016-05-14 02:30:49 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] So as long as these contests are in such sterile environments, I have no interest in the winners.
[2016-05-14 02:31:24 -0500] [lok in #debian] cypher_: i m plannnig for odroid but not sure when i ll buy it; also have upcoming plans to buy either i3 or i5 of NUC ; what would be wise decision?
[2016-05-14 02:31:33 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] .coffee all
[2016-05-14 02:31:34 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] You can do it with your flash drive.
[2016-05-14 02:31:35 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] brews a warm, cracked mug of coffee and hands it to all
[2016-05-14 02:31:46 -0500] [lok in #debian] cynicallemon: how to get shell account?
[2016-05-14 02:31:52 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] One mug is kind of hard to share. 8)
[2016-05-14 02:32:21 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] wise decision would be buying a used Dell computer off ebay they are cheaper than dirt
[2016-05-14 02:32:31 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And that is my rant against the current music industry.
[2016-05-14 02:32:45 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] lok, a couple of links were posted a few minutes ago
[2016-05-14 02:32:46 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] core2duo with 4GB (2 is enough) of RAM and cheapo monitor
[2016-05-14 02:33:01 -0500] [lok in #debian] yes i am still reviewing thanks guys cynicallemon

[2016-05-14 02:33:30 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] I mean I would recommend getting a raspberry pi with a cheap monitor/keyboard/mouse
[2016-05-14 02:33:36 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, I'm still listening to Simple Minds.
[2016-05-14 02:33:53 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] buy now and start now, NUC is a fine toy but you can have a laptop for that price - a new one
[2016-05-14 02:33:54 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ok, fair enough
[2016-05-14 02:33:56 -0500] [lok in #debian] "[12:58] <Wonderscript> One to hold your installation image and the other to install the operating system too.." i am not yet clear; what is image? why something to be installed?isnt that portable/live?
[2016-05-14 02:34:29 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] used Dell is not much more expensive than raspberry pi
[2016-05-14 02:34:33 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] The installation image to install the operating system. You need to install it somewhere like a flash drive. Once it is installed to your flash drive it'll be portable.
[2016-05-14 02:34:49 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish, I prefer music of the 80s and early 90s and some prior to the 80s. After the early 90s, I lost interest.
[2016-05-14 02:34:57 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] Dell Optiplex or similar
[2016-05-14 02:34:59 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] an RPi is fine but an older box will be just as cheap and have more potential
[2016-05-14 02:35:04 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] True
[2016-05-14 02:35:05 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] yep
[2016-05-14 02:35:19 -0500] [lok in #debian] cypher_: can you suggest some link of ebay dell i ll check rest of all similar myself
[2016-05-14 02:35:52 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, still if you look hard enough, some astounding music can be found which is quiet recent
[2016-05-14 02:35:54 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] When grunge came, I retreated to earlier times.
[2016-05-14 02:36:22 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i like all kinds of music, very few restrictions, but it has to breath quality
[2016-05-14 02:36:33 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] lok, you could try some local schools or colleges as some will have a few decommissioned ones waiting to be scrapped
[2016-05-14 02:36:52 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I may find new music in the films and TV series I watch and listen to of course.
[2016-05-14 02:37:01 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] http://www.ebay.com/bhp/dell-optiplex-755
[2016-05-14 02:37:02 -0500] [lok in #debian] i already have other accesories like bluetoth mouse/keyboard/monitor i can manage; only concern is about board/cpu selection
[2016-05-14 02:37:47 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] if you have more money buy one with i5 its better for virtualization
[2016-05-14 02:38:08 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] if not stick to cheap core2duo with near 3GHz clock
[2016-05-14 02:38:22 -0500] [lok in #debian] i guess used dell may not support usb 3.0 or hdmi; can it? cypher_ as i guess they may be older version
[2016-05-14 02:38:41 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] There was a song in the 90s I liked, but I have to correct the grammar of it all the time in my head.
[2016-05-14 02:38:45 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] lok, probably not
[2016-05-14 02:39:04 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] we don't know your finsncial situation
[2016-05-14 02:39:10 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] it's hard to suggest
[2016-05-14 02:39:14 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] something

[2016-05-14 02:39:56 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] The song is by Joan Osborne called What if God Was One of Us. The correct grammar is What if God Were One of Us. Like the song, except the bad grammar.
[2016-05-14 02:40:01 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] yep you can buy one with HDD for few bucks more
[2016-05-14 02:40:01 -0500] [lok in #debian] for board 50USD and for computer/laptop 350USD max.
[2016-05-14 02:40:42 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] for 350 you can have a used dell and a new lenovo laptop here in EU
[2016-05-14 02:40:45 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] idk US
[2016-05-14 02:40:46 -0500] [lok in #debian] so if it doesnt have hdd; how to use it?

[2016-05-14 02:41:16 -0500] [cypher_ in #debian] you will need to learn about computer "guts" also
[2016-05-14 02:41:28 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Or listen to music on the 80s Music Choice channel.

[2016-05-14 02:42:21 -0500] [lok in #debian] thanks cypher
[2016-05-14 02:42:23 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok:  what are you absolutely looking to do with the computer, and what are you looking to do but as an option?
[2016-05-14 02:42:31 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: this is great!
[2016-05-14 02:43:32 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Thank you jmcnaught  for a great conversation about science fiction/fantasy TV series earlier. Usually at this time of night, I am a YouTube zombie chain smoking. You've kept my fingers so busy, I've smoked very little this evening and am not a zombie.
[2016-05-14 02:43:45 -0500] [lok in #debian] learnign now
[2016-05-14 02:43:54 -0500] [lok in #debian] not abut future interest
[2016-05-14 02:44:01 -0500] [lok in #debian] not sure abt future interests
[2016-05-14 02:44:06 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And I've got to rant about music, so thank you dutchfish.
[2016-05-14 02:44:06 -0500] [lok in #debian] i guess i like maths
[2016-05-14 02:44:17 -0500] [lok in #debian] hence labview, matlab willl be interesting for me
[2016-05-14 02:44:18 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Have a nice $daypart!
[2016-05-14 02:44:20 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: cheers :) i'll check out some of your recommendations. have a good one
[2016-05-14 02:45:02 -0500] [lok in #debian] i allos like data so R may be useful
[2016-05-14 02:45:04 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] disappears in a puff of steam.
[2016-05-14 02:45:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, i did 2 of her conecerts in Paris, i love her music

[2016-05-14 02:56:24 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] ah, first BBQ grilling yesterday
[2016-05-14 02:56:33 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] unfortunately, I managed to choke my neighbours
[2016-05-14 02:56:56 -0500] [lok in #debian] cynicallemon: how sdf will help?
[2016-05-14 02:57:35 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, smoked fish? ;)
[2016-05-14 02:57:49 -0500] [lok in #debian] _ebola_:
[2016-05-14 02:58:13 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] No, you wrerent invited :p
[2016-05-14 02:58:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] hahahaha
[2016-05-14 02:58:22 -0500] [lok in #debian] what is good used core2duo or rpi board?
[2016-05-14 02:58:44 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: well we used to do matlab jsut fine with 1990's computers:)
[2016-05-14 02:59:22 -0500] [trewas in #debian] matlab is x86-64 only, it will not work on rpi or even (very) old PCs
[2016-05-14 02:59:31 -0500] [lok in #debian] what is use of sdf; i checked link but not sure what it is _ebola_
[2016-05-14 02:59:33 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: really any math stuff will be trivial for any CPU, as math is dependant on numerical computation algorithm complexity, not on CPU's so much
[2016-05-14 03:00:03 -0500] [lok in #debian] _ebola_:  and trewas are different statement?
[2016-05-14 03:00:19 -0500] [lok in #debian] confused
[2016-05-14 03:00:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, we had a great bbq on thuersday
[2016-05-14 03:01:16 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: Since your needs are modest  I have an idea
[2016-05-14 03:01:30 -0500] [trewas in #debian] lok: matlab is closed source and only available for x86-64, but it could work with whatever CPU if mathworks made it available, but they don't
[2016-05-14 03:01:35 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: how about you build your computer brand new for $350 (or less)?
[2016-05-14 03:02:03 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: this way you will have HDMI and USB 3.0
[2016-05-14 03:02:20 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Hope it was tasty and that no-one accidentally skinned you and threw you on the grill
[2016-05-14 03:02:22 -0500] [lok in #debian] ok _ebola_ how to build? which things to take care? any flow chart?
[2016-05-14 03:03:02 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: lets start with the motherboard, you may want to get one with the CPU and power supply intergrated already
[2016-05-14 03:03:09 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: would octave suit your needs? ipython and python libaries contain. There is also sagemath (Which includes R)
[2016-05-14 03:03:24 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, well, that would be an ackward view ;)
[2016-05-14 03:03:38 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: something like this: http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/N3150DC-ITX/
[2016-05-14 03:04:01 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I was in the outdoor store yesterday, got two small-side "bags" for my hiking bahg, a new waterbottle of natural materials w/o the usual ches etc., a waterticked pocket for minor stuffs and some of the small .... hook thinkies for attacking cargo to things
[2016-05-14 03:04:10 -0500] [lok in #debian] somiaj: python is one more thing i want to learn as it can handle maths very easily
[2016-05-14 03:04:27 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] and then a relaxinfg 22 km bike ride with friends through the Lyngby fores...
[2016-05-14 03:04:36 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] and then impromptu grill evening
[2016-05-14 03:04:42 -0500] [lok in #debian] newegg is in india but unfortunately shipping cost is half of item cost
[2016-05-14 03:04:50 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] i found out that the may in the back of my fridge wasn't stale :)
[2016-05-14 03:04:53 -0500] [lok in #debian] i have seen asrock boards on newegg sometimes iirc
[2016-05-14 03:04:55 -0500] [memyself in #debian] how to get a copy of debian junior
[2016-05-14 03:05:03 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: everything I listed there is installable on the debian arm port.
[2016-05-14 03:05:06 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] lok, asrock is garbage.
[2016-05-14 03:05:23 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: it doesn't have to be newegg
[2016-05-14 03:05:40 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] the mayonaise
[2016-05-14 03:05:44 -0500] [lok in #debian] other sites are also costlier in india _ebola_
[2016-05-14 03:05:59 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianJr -- its a pureblend so you really just need to install the list of packages ont he debian system.
[2016-05-14 03:06:03 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: and doesn't have to be asus, the idea is a modern ATOM CPU (Broadwell generation) with the power supply integrated in the motherboard (the "DC" part)
[2016-05-14 03:06:16 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Ive become very physically active lately, compared to what was once myu lethally sedentary standard
[2016-05-14 03:06:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] _ebola_, atom processors are weak.
[2016-05-14 03:06:44 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: so with this one purchase all you have to do is mount this board into a case, and plug in the hard drive, monitor, and the included power brick (external)
[2016-05-14 03:07:02 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: https://people.debian.org/~synrg/junior-doc/quickguide/ might be helpful too
[2016-05-14 03:07:09 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] newer Broadwell atoms are quite nice, they are out of order units now and quad core
[2016-05-14 03:07:19 -0500] [lok in #debian] will that configuration be better than i5?
[2016-05-14 03:07:24 -0500] [lok in #debian] _ebola_:
[2016-05-14 03:07:28 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] they aren't like the old in-order atoms
[2016-05-14 03:08:11 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: well for what you are doing it will be better probably, it will give you a more flexible modern computer and save you some money
[2016-05-14 03:08:27 -0500] [lok in #debian] ok
[2016-05-14 03:08:57 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] the CPU is already mounted on the motherboard with a passive heatsink
[2016-05-14 03:09:15 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] and you get the power supply built in too
[2016-05-14 03:09:19 -0500] [memyself in #debian] somiaj, thanks for your help
[2016-05-14 03:09:28 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] say it saves you a lot of money
[2016-05-14 03:09:48 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] graphics card is built in
[2016-05-14 03:10:08 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, maybe because of spring
[2016-05-14 03:10:22 -0500] [lok in #debian] i  m not sure octave, ipython, sagemath , matlab which one to choose now? i can only decide after trying each & very software somiaj
[2016-05-14 03:10:28 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, works for me
[2016-05-14 03:10:29 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] _ebola_, lok: hardware dissucsions are a bit off topic here, might take the conversation elsewhere if it is going to last for a while.
[2016-05-14 03:10:44 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Cant rule though out, but Ive seen a significant health improvement over the past coupel of months...
[2016-05-14 03:10:52 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Or year to stretch it a bit
[2016-05-14 03:11:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] yeh
[2016-05-14 03:11:05 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] BTW; B-vitamin still gives me massive boosts of energy
[2016-05-14 03:11:11 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: matlab is closed source. Debian provides packages for ocatve, ipython and many of the math python libaries. Debian does not provide packages for sagemath and you'll have to isntall that from upstream.
[2016-05-14 03:11:12 -0500] [lok in #debian] how to have debian on portable thumb drive? if i have debian do i need ubuntu? or other similar linux software?
[2016-05-14 03:11:35 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i dont fool around with vitamins, i just try to avoid junk food
[2016-05-14 03:11:57 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: debian is a full os, you don't need ubuntu or other similar software. You can install debian directly to a usb drive, though many usb drives are slow and a live image gives better preforamnce in many cases (setting up persistance is helpfull with live images)
[2016-05-14 03:12:19 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I know youve cautioned me against vit supprements int he past, dont be worry, IO'm not taking nearly as much as Ray Kurzweil.
[2016-05-14 03:12:23 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] just the dutch 3 x 'R'
[2016-05-14 03:12:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] debian can boot fro musb drives, as so can many other distros as a "full install"
[2016-05-14 03:12:36 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] rust, reinheid en regelmaat
[2016-05-14 03:12:49 -0500] [Wonderscript in #debian] your usb drive is basically treated as a hard drive so its the same as installing to a hard drive
[2016-05-14 03:12:54 -0500] [lok in #debian] ii have usb 3.0 drive
[2016-05-14 03:13:09 -0500] [lok in #debian] 32gb is sufficient?
[2016-05-14 03:13:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] translate into rest, clean and regularety
[2016-05-14 03:13:19 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I have likewise cut down on junk, I did have a binge of buying in auitumn, due to busyness taking away a lot of time, but in the end I realized hjow poorly it tasted because I found a proper bruger restarant in town, after that I won't touch regular junk unless I'm in starvation
[2016-05-14 03:13:26 -0500] [memyself in #debian] the package live-helper does not exist
[2016-05-14 03:13:30 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: depends on what you want to do, but that should be plenty for many thigns.
[2016-05-14 03:13:38 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] ,v live-helper
[2016-05-14 03:13:39 -0500] [judd in #debian] Package: live-helper on amd64 -- squeeze: 2.0.12-2
[2016-05-14 03:13:47 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] you are what you eat ;)
[2016-05-14 03:13:51 -0500] [_ebola_ in #debian] lok: with the modern motherboard that has usb 3.0 you don't even need a hard drive if you have a usb 3.0 external device actually
[2016-05-14 03:13:53 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: oh looks like the documentation is a bit out of date, the live images may have changed a bit.
[2016-05-14 03:13:53 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] precis, dat herinner ik ook
[2016-05-14 03:14:02 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: are you wanting to create a debian-junior live image?
[2016-05-14 03:14:07 -0500] [lok in #debian] is bootable thumb drive=live thumb drive=portable OS thumb drive?
[2016-05-14 03:14:13 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] it still works very well ;)
[2016-05-14 03:14:16 -0500] [xormor in #debian] one can also put the ISO into a memory chip, MicroSD chip.
[2016-05-14 03:14:25 -0500] [memyself in #debian] yes
[2016-05-14 03:14:30 -0500] [xormor in #debian] USB drive can be better.
[2016-05-14 03:14:32 -0500] [lok in #debian] i think such terms doesnt need any installation/configuration on computer
[2016-05-14 03:14:40 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] and vitamins in massive dossage are dangerous to your health
[2016-05-14 03:14:44 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: live images run from memeory as opposed to a bootable usb drive will run from the usb drive itself.
[2016-05-14 03:14:49 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I don't use that much soap though, as I find it harmful to the skin
[2016-05-14 03:15:03 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Yeah, fat solubles like A tend to cause liver damage
[2016-05-14 03:15:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] specially on the B2 and B6
[2016-05-14 03:15:30 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: so they are different in how they work. The nice thing about live images as they do run faster once everything is loaded, but I haven't playe dmuch with usb 3.0, maybe the preformance loss from isntall right on the usb isn't there with a fully compadable 3.0 device
[2016-05-14 03:15:43 -0500] [lok in #debian] are virtual box also portable?
[2016-05-14 03:15:50 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] How so? THe B vits are water soluble and get flushed when inb excess
[2016-05-14 03:15:59 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: I don't know what ot suggest if that documentation is out of date. Might want to look at the documentation in the junior-doc package
[2016-05-14 03:16:06 -0500] [lok in #debian] can i install multiiple portable OS on my same thumb 32GB drive?
[2016-05-14 03:16:26 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] lok: you can treate a usb drive just like a harddisk, so provided you have enoughs pace for what you want to do.
[2016-05-14 03:16:59 -0500] [memyself in #debian] somiaj: i will try to build a live cd
[2016-05-14 03:17:03 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] no, they B2 as an example in overdose inhibits the meta to digest vitamin K
[2016-05-14 03:17:16 -0500] [memyself in #debian] somiaj: thanks
[2016-05-14 03:17:19 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] they are antagonistic
[2016-05-14 03:17:51 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: there is #debian-live on irc.oftc.net, but I'm not familar with how to build custom live cds (and unsure if the debian-junior project has any prebuilt ones)
[2016-05-14 03:18:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] in simple terms dont use vitamin supplements unless you are suffering from a difficiency proven by a lab test
[2016-05-14 03:18:26 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] True, and as I recall, too much B6 can mask deficiencies in B12, which is potentially very dangerous
[2016-05-14 03:18:32 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] at best supplements are not harmfull in low dossage, but of no use either
[2016-05-14 03:19:04 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Well, over the pays 8 years, the use of B-vitamins have proven very usefuil to me on a moderate dose.
[2016-05-14 03:19:07 -0500] [memyself in #debian] somiaj: thanks
[2016-05-14 03:19:14 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] memyself: yea that doc just seems oudated, maybe try #debian-jr on irc.oftc.net as well.
[2016-05-14 03:19:28 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] there is a reason why vitamins have a much better effect in natural food then as in vitro produced ones
[2016-05-14 03:20:00 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] organically bound I suppose
[2016-05-14 03:20:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] well, unless you dont eat meat, you hardly can manage to get a shortage of the majr B2, B6 and B12
[2016-05-14 03:20:38 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] or beans
[2016-05-14 03:20:46 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] vegans are a typical danger group for B12 def
[2016-05-14 03:20:57 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] but I doeat a lot of meat - at least yesterday
[2016-05-14 03:21:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] even that is questionary
[2016-05-14 03:21:43 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] beans, soja and lots of other like green peace, contains massive amounts of B12
[2016-05-14 03:21:56 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] my 2 cents
[2016-05-14 03:22:07 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I like beans!
[2016-05-14 03:22:12 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] my two eurocent
[2016-05-14 03:22:26 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, alright
[2016-05-14 03:23:00 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] :)
[2016-05-14 03:23:23 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] but yeah, a can of bakesbeans with some slicced red peppers are a decent dinner or night snack
[2016-05-14 03:23:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] btw, did you know that a lare intake of B-vitamins makes you agressive?
[2016-05-14 03:23:58 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] s/lare/large
[2016-05-14 03:24:18 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] nope, do tell. I thought it was just my testosterone :)

[2016-05-14 03:25:50 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] all the fatty soluble
[2016-05-14 03:25:53 -0500] [lok in #debian] Wonderscript: if installation image is available all the time; do i need to reserve one thumb drive for it?
[2016-05-14 03:25:55 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ones
[2016-05-14 03:26:01 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] B are all water soluble
[2016-05-14 03:26:10 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] that woudl be A and D, E? K?
[2016-05-14 03:26:14 -0500] [lok in #debian] i am still stuck here
[2016-05-14 03:26:15 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] not inside the whole chain of working
[2016-05-14 03:26:19 -0500] [lok in #debian] [13:04] <Wonderscript> The installation image to install the operating system. You need to install it somewhere like a flash drive. Once it is installed to your flash drive it'll be portable.
[2016-05-14 03:26:25 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] yes D3 as well
[2016-05-14 03:26:47 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Well there can of course be precursors to B that was fatty sol
[2016-05-14 03:26:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] E only in very massive overdoses, hard to do
[2016-05-14 03:27:04 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] D3 yes, though D3 shoudl be the best of the Ds, as opposed to in particular D2
[2016-05-14 03:27:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] yes, precartenoids
[2016-05-14 03:27:24 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Im unfamiliar withE and K.... I've read that preggy weomen should do K :)
[2016-05-14 03:27:25 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] as in B12

[2016-05-14 03:27:42 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] if it is not pie'd over ;)
[2016-05-14 03:28:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] anyway, dont mess with vitamins unless you absolutely sure of a diffiency, my 2 cents ;)
[2016-05-14 03:29:24 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] once you have installed debian you don't need to have the installation media any more, though it can be a useful rescue disk if ever needed
[2016-05-14 03:29:30 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] just eat a carrot :3
[2016-05-14 03:29:42 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, or 2, right ;)
[2016-05-14 03:29:48 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] attack of the killer tomatoes!
[2016-05-14 03:32:53 -0500] [lok in #debian] not sure what it is/
[2016-05-14 03:32:58 -0500] [lok in #debian] sorry
[2016-05-14 03:33:33 -0500] [lok in #debian] if live image/installation file is always available oneline; i dont think i need to have rescue disk; as my rescue disk=online website
[2016-05-14 03:33:35 -0500] [lok in #debian] isnt it?
[2016-05-14 03:34:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] lok, not sure if the live one offers.. but the official installer offers a quick chroot option when rescue is chosen
[2016-05-14 03:35:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, rem there is also something like stomage fauna, over 1200 species are ruling your life, you dont want to mess and imbalance those ;)
[2016-05-14 03:36:29 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] mumbles sometimes i wish i didnt studie so much .....
[2016-05-14 03:38:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, last week i was delving into that other OS latest
[2016-05-14 03:39:52 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] its all about parralelism ....
[2016-05-14 03:40:10 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] and still not solved
[2016-05-14 03:40:39 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i wonder if OSes get the adaption for whats coming
[2016-05-14 03:41:44 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] its all limping hehind
[2016-05-14 03:42:15 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] hmm, yeah. technology from the 70s and 80s.
[2016-05-14 03:42:31 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] kernels didn't change muchs from then.
[2016-05-14 03:42:43 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] the sacrifition for parrelelism to work is to costly in latest kernels
[2016-05-14 03:43:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] when it comes to classic core bound processes, it didnt get better, it just got slower
[2016-05-14 03:44:41 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] and pre-emption got worse as well
[2016-05-14 03:44:54 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] sorry for the rant
[2016-05-14 03:45:42 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] found some books on parallel computing and algorithms in the libs yesterday. not something you can read on s sunday x)
[2016-05-14 03:45:46 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] s/s/a
[2016-05-14 03:45:55 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] hah, right
[2016-05-14 03:46:26 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] the problem is: it is all too chatty
[2016-05-14 03:46:46 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] it talks too much, like me ;)
[2016-05-14 03:47:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] to get talk in sink, it takes time
[2016-05-14 03:47:44 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] s/sink/sync
[2016-05-14 03:47:45 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] and a bus that grows in size x² with the number of nodes.
[2016-05-14 03:48:24 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] yup, and busses are too slow in general, hard to improve that
[2016-05-14 03:48:47 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] we have nice fast mem nowadays, but we can't use it to the full extend
[2016-05-14 03:49:01 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] parralelism there too
[2016-05-14 03:49:24 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] its wrong
[2016-05-14 03:50:05 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] or at least how it is implemented
[2016-05-14 03:50:49 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] an ant colony doesnt need to talk much, still it can act as one entity ;)
[2016-05-14 03:51:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] nature did a far better job :)
[2016-05-14 03:52:10 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] its time for smart data, and crypto data
[2016-05-14 03:53:52 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] most OSes weren't designed with that in mind back then
[2016-05-14 03:54:20 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] yeah, will be interesting how all of this turns out.
[2016-05-14 03:54:31 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] basically it was all based on calculus only
[2016-05-14 03:54:45 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] that will change
[2016-05-14 03:55:56 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] specialisation instead of parralelism i bet
[2016-05-14 03:56:25 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] intresting times .....
[2016-05-14 03:57:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] meanwhile i am still tinkering with my softcpu
[2016-05-14 03:57:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i also got some new boards with more capable fpga's
[2016-05-14 03:57:30 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Debian8 forever!

[2016-05-14 03:58:09 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] and yes, debian is very important for the future
[2016-05-14 03:58:22 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] thats for sure
[2016-05-14 03:58:54 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] if linux falls behind debian will just switch to a different kernel and keep on going.
[2016-05-14 03:59:26 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, yup, look at openbsd and all the arches, its so nice

[2016-05-14 04:13:45 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] according to my logs he was doing this on #linux as well
[2016-05-14 04:13:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] but nobody is even here anyways
[2016-05-14 04:14:08 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] he just needs parenting attention

[2016-05-14 04:33:48 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Roasted Python is best served in a pita with tzatziki, tomatoes and chips
[2016-05-14 04:34:36 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] But why don't you use Ubuntu? It's so easy and comes with python preinstalled
[2016-05-14 04:39:15 -0500] [guggu in #debian] hello, has anyone installed debian on a mac book? the old ones (intel)
[2016-05-14 04:39:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, anything intel you will imho have less issues than with ppc
[2016-05-14 04:40:20 -0500] [guggu in #debian] yeah ive got an intel mac book
[2016-05-14 04:40:57 -0500] [guggu in #debian] im trying to follow this documentation https://wiki.debian.org/MacBook#Debian_installation
[2016-05-14 04:41:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, there's  a linux firmware command for mac efi.. but you can just renamed grubx64.efi (on efi partition) to /EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI and that can solve things as well
[2016-05-14 04:41:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, if you're trying to dual-boot the mac, you should look into refind
[2016-05-14 04:41:44 -0500] [guggu in #debian] nah i want to single boot
[2016-05-14 04:42:04 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i cant get the bootloader to recognize the usb iso

[2016-05-14 04:42:39 -0500] [guggu in #debian] problem is, the guide links to this http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx
[2016-05-14 04:43:10 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, that's not a dd
[2016-05-14 04:43:30 -0500] [guggu in #debian] which clearly does not work, it literally says so at the last screenshot: "the created boot device will not boot off a mac...."
[2016-05-14 04:43:32 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !unetbootin
[2016-05-14 04:43:32 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] UNetbootin (Universal Netboot Installer) allows creation of bootable USB drives for a variety of Linux distributions.  http://unetbootin.sf.net/  Not recommended for use with Debian CD/DVD images, as it mangles the installer in cruel and unusual ways, resulting in hard to debug problems.  Ask me about <hybrid images>, <usb install>, <win32diskimager>.
[2016-05-14 04:43:41 -0500] [markybob in #debian] guggu: yeah, unetbootin breaks debian
[2016-05-14 04:44:01 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, try finding your usb stick with the root command (osx),  diskutil list<> ... and use dd if=file.sios of=/dev/rdisk<SUB NUMBER>  -- sub the number for the actual usb
[2016-05-14 04:44:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, and maybe use bs=10m
[2016-05-14 04:44:45 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, which python? ;)
[2016-05-14 04:45:33 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, most of the time i end up, with installing some obscure libs
[2016-05-14 04:45:52 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i hate that
[2016-05-14 04:46:21 -0500] [guggu in #debian] jml2 can i launch that from linux?
[2016-05-14 04:46:26 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] A semi-related question: If I rename debian/grubx64.efi to boot/bootx64.efi, will it automatically appear in the EFI boot menu even if I don't add it using efibootmgr, etc.?
[2016-05-14 04:46:28 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] no mather what distro
[2016-05-14 04:46:33 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, you can launch it from the osx terminal
[2016-05-14 04:46:37 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] On a regular EFI system, not Mac
[2016-05-14 04:47:08 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] some fortran based stuff that takes forever to build D:
[2016-05-14 04:47:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] guggu, my suggestion is if doing it in osx, is to use the appropriate "rdiskN" device (note: "r" at the beginning)
[2016-05-14 04:47:14 -0500] [markybob in #debian] guggu: see https://wiki.debian.org/MacBook and https://wiki.debian.org/MacBookPro
[2016-05-14 04:47:26 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] gigles
[2016-05-14 04:48:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, bootx64.efi is a fallback location standard for uefi boots -- you also have to have it in /efi/boot/
[2016-05-14 04:48:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, and you can just rename grubx64.efi and it'll boot
[2016-05-14 04:48:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, (to that location)
[2016-05-14 04:49:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, this is helpful if you don't want to touch the mac uefi hardware
[2016-05-14 04:49:18 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] jml2: So if I copy that file on two of my drives EFI partition under that name, even if the disk where I installed grub fails (or another power failure deletes the EFI boot entry, like it happened yesterday), I will be able to just select it from the menu, not take a few days to figure out how to create a rescue disk?
[2016-05-14 04:49:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, saw a vid a week ago from a guy doing some stuff with python on rch linux, biting his own tail off, fun to watch

[2016-05-14 04:50:18 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] let me refind it, a sec

[2016-05-14 04:51:27 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] python c extensions are pretty cool though. had to rewrite some python code for an employer some time ago. it was really easy to implement those as extensions.
[2016-05-14 04:51:45 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ran like 4 times faster afterwards.
[2016-05-14 04:51:48 -0500] [pial in #debian] i have dual booted jessie with win10 in uefi only mode. bios had 2 bootloader uefi win10 and uefi debian. my bios got corrupted and after recovery only uefi win10 bootloader is shown. how do i get debian bootloader back?
[2016-05-14 04:51:58 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, your official debian installer cd/usb is already a resuce disk
[2016-05-14 04:52:09 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !tell pial -about fixmbr
[2016-05-14 04:52:18 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hexnewbie, but the boot-repair offers a 1-click things fix for uefi and mbr grub boots
[2016-05-14 04:52:41 -0500] [markybob in #debian] though i think you've got your terms fucked up. "bios" corrupted? i doubt it
[2016-05-14 04:52:59 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] jml2: Thanks for the hints. :)
[2016-05-14 04:53:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, sure, i was basically ranting on all the python versions, not python itself
[2016-05-14 04:54:10 -0500] [markybob in #debian] pial: you have secure boot turned off in bios, right?
[2016-05-14 04:54:26 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pial, use the rescue disk, get to a chroot and do update-grub<enter>  -- you might have to mount the efi partition to /boot/efi though
[2016-05-14 04:54:26 -0500] [markybob in #debian] pial: windows 10 machines have it on by default, generally.
[2016-05-14 04:54:28 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, i have msi x99a sli plus motherboard, it has 2 bios, the first one did not post after powerfailure but second one did. so i said it got corrupted
[2016-05-14 04:54:43 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, yes
[2016-05-14 04:55:01 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pial, you should be able to fix it very easy with a chroot prompt from the debian installer/resuce cd/usb

[2016-05-14 04:55:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, luckely debian has diversions ;)
[2016-05-14 04:55:38 -0500] [markybob in #debian] it doesn't have 2 bios
[2016-05-14 04:56:21 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/twitter_bot.png
[2016-05-14 04:56:23 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] :>
[2016-05-14 04:56:54 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, it says multiple bios right in the manual with a flip switch in the motherboard to choose them
[2016-05-14 04:56:58 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] lol, they are always nice
[2016-05-14 04:57:19 -0500] [markybob in #debian] pial: okay. follow what i had the bot tell you
[2016-05-14 04:57:49 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, ok will try that, thanks
[2016-05-14 04:59:49 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, mount -t ext2 /dev/whatever /target..........what does target mean here?
[2016-05-14 05:00:12 -0500] [guggu in #debian] the directory where you want to mount
[2016-05-14 05:00:16 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob, do i give it an arbitrary name?
[2016-05-14 05:00:22 -0500] [guggu in #debian] mkdir dir
[2016-05-14 05:00:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] sure
[2016-05-14 05:00:25 -0500] [guggu in #debian] and mount there
[2016-05-14 05:00:35 -0500] [guggu in #debian] or just add some directory to the fstab
[2016-05-14 05:00:41 -0500] [markybob in #debian]  /mnt or wherever. doesn't matter
[2016-05-14 05:00:58 -0500] [pial in #debian] ok
[2016-05-14 05:01:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] time for formula one :D
[2016-05-14 05:02:18 -0500] [pial in #debian] markybob,  run "mount /boot/efi" on EFI......by "EFI" where does it mean?
[2016-05-14 05:02:20 -0500] [guggu in #debian] so guys say i've got this fat32 pendrive. if i dd the debian image on that, will i bi able to boot it with a mac?
[2016-05-14 05:02:41 -0500] [guggu in #debian] *be
[2016-05-14 05:04:15 -0500] [pial in #debian] aw markybob left, can someone tell me what does "EFI" in  "run "mount /boot/efi" on EFI" <--- means?
[2016-05-14 05:04:31 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: the installer? Yes
[2016-05-14 05:04:52 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: sorry i meant the installer, yes
[2016-05-14 05:04:57 -0500] [pial in #debian] is it a location? if yes what is the path?
[2016-05-14 05:05:29 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: so i should be able to do the cmd think and it should show up at boot along with the hard disc, right?
[2016-05-14 05:06:11 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Oh, big traditional party in Ulm, probably with costumes!
[2016-05-14 05:06:17 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: i thought there were some restrictions, like mac cant boot from anything that isnt formatted in some specific way
[2016-05-14 05:06:45 -0500] [guggu in #debian] sorry about these questions but i never used a mac im my life, i could barely open a terminal there
[2016-05-14 05:07:15 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: I have no idea of what you're talking about. The installer iso will boot on a mac if you do it as per instructions to a USB stick
[2016-05-14 05:07:38 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: year/model of the Mac?
[2016-05-14 05:07:55 -0500] [guggu in #debian] its a mac book with an intel core2 duo
[2016-05-14 05:08:07 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] I meant dd not do sorry
[2016-05-14 05:08:38 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i'm talking about stuff like this: https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-linux-live-usb-in-mac/
[2016-05-14 05:08:55 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Oh a santarosa? It will boot. Just make sure you install all the updates from Apple
[2016-05-14 05:10:25 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: it's a mb 3.1 or 4.1?
[2016-05-14 05:12:41 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: lemme check
[2016-05-14 05:14:00 -0500] [guggu in #debian] it'a 2,1
[2016-05-14 05:14:49 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: if you have an existing osx there install all the updates.
[2016-05-14 05:16:23 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: says: your software is up to date
[2016-05-14 05:16:31 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Then dd the iso to the.USB. Boot the.mb while pressing essing C
[2016-05-14 05:16:54 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Pressing. Sorry I'm.on the phone
[2016-05-14 05:16:55 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: you mean cmd?
[2016-05-14 05:16:59 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Yep
[2016-05-14 05:17:35 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: k im currently dd-ing, its taking ages prolly cause i did not set the bs=...
[2016-05-14 05:17:54 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: still, i came here cause i tried before and it did not work
[2016-05-14 05:18:10 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Just wait. Grab a ☕
[2016-05-14 05:18:28 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: are you really sure that the pendrive's filesystem does not affect booting?
[2016-05-14 05:18:35 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Heh
[2016-05-14 05:18:46 -0500] [guggu in #debian] ha!
[2016-05-14 05:18:47 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Pretty sure
[2016-05-14 05:19:39 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i'm so fascinated with the dd command, never quite got what it actually does
[2016-05-14 05:22:50 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Also, big party here with costumes: http://www.karneval-berlin.de/en/english.175.html
[2016-05-14 05:24:46 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] A completely organised event. People need a license to sell drinks and food and the orga team dictates the prices
[2016-05-14 05:24:47 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] omg i have things in my stomach!
[2016-05-14 05:25:38 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] You find the coolest microorganisms in your colon
[2016-05-14 05:26:45 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] processinc of dat ain common usage is quite interesting. the GHz progression stopped with the P4...then came COre and COre 2 with its on chip multiproc, and it worked fabulously.
[2016-05-14 05:27:52 -0500] [guggu in #debian] oh and by the way: if unetbootin is known to "break" the debian installation iso, the installation guide should really refer to dd instead
[2016-05-14 05:38:22 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: the installation guide really refers to cp instead
[2016-05-14 05:40:20 -0500] [jelly in #debian] cp uses variable block size and requires less tinkering than dd; using dd sometimes makes an incomplete copy for various reasons
[2016-05-14 05:49:32 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, yes, fabulousy
[2016-05-14 05:51:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, the general improvement comes from a different direction
[2016-05-14 05:53:37 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, it is still within its infant shoes. As long as all the energy is mostly turned into heat.....
[2016-05-14 05:54:23 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, some more cores and your cellphone will selfignite in your pocket ;)
[2016-05-14 05:57:59 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, http://www.photonics-event.nl/programma/programma-2-juni/
[2016-05-14 05:58:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes: are you going?
[2016-05-14 05:58:38 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, probably, yes
[2016-05-14 05:58:59 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] If they get caught in a loop.
[2016-05-14 05:59:17 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ewew, well, then you prolly get a laser ;)
[2016-05-14 06:00:31 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] "On-chip integration of rare-earth ion doped waveguide active devices"   sounds interesting.
[2016-05-14 06:00:44 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] nods
[2016-05-14 06:00:59 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] and some more niche edge thingies
[2016-05-14 06:01:14 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] well. its hard today to maintain a sane power consumption on android phone. The rule why turn off aplications, they must be available immidieatly.
[2016-05-14 06:01:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] like terahertz switching
[2016-05-14 06:01:56 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] I'm all for cheaper and less hot fiber SFPs
[2016-05-14 06:02:06 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] The apple destroid the OS and IT.
[2016-05-14 06:02:07 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] those things really heat up
[2016-05-14 06:02:07 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, oh, absolutely
[2016-05-14 06:02:14 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] there are so many unwanted effects with so high frequency switching.
[2016-05-14 06:02:17 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Yeah, thje Huawei (pronounced WHo? Nowaii!) boasted Octacore procs, but the ones I've talked to about it were displeased with it
[2016-05-14 06:02:28 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Its being edvertised on all the bus stops here in Denmark atm
[2016-05-14 06:02:29 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] lots of parasitic forces.
[2016-05-14 06:02:56 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, and you screamed, 'witches'? hah, thats really black art
[2016-05-14 06:03:08 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] High Frequency Witches
[2016-05-14 06:03:33 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: what I'd really like is tiny robots crawling alongside existing copper lines and replacing them with fiber :-)
[2016-05-14 06:03:48 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] hi
[2016-05-14 06:04:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, well, miracles we perform on demand, the impossible takes a bit longer ;)
[2016-05-14 06:04:07 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] I got now 3 days on bat with current 53 percent bat.
[2016-05-14 06:04:18 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i had circuit engineering for one semester. the formulas there were gigantic. a headache that was...
[2016-05-14 06:04:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] ewew: you got a bat-mobile?
[2016-05-14 06:04:48 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] battery. i used bat for short.
[2016-05-14 06:04:58 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] hi
[2016-05-14 06:05:13 -0500] [guggu in #debian] jelly: as dd did not work for me, im retrying with cat
[2016-05-14 06:05:25 -0500] [jelly in #debian] cp
[2016-05-14 06:05:26 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] name
[2016-05-14 06:05:28 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i guess ill give cp a shot next time
[2016-05-14 06:05:57 -0500] [guggu in #debian] can you link to the page? im talking about this one https://wiki.debian.org/MacBook#Debian_installation
[2016-05-14 06:06:43 -0500] [guggu in #debian] when you click on the "instructions" link it opens an ubuntu page describing the process with unetbootin
[2016-05-14 06:07:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] mumbles i wish a was a bit younger with all the new intresting things coming at us .....
[2016-05-14 06:07:12 -0500] [guggu in #debian] jelly: oh i should probably tell you that im doing the mac book specific installation guide
[2016-05-14 06:07:26 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] guggu, you can validate with `cmp /dev/usbstick yourfile.iso`. if it says `EOF on /dev/usbstick`, the copy is good
[2016-05-14 06:07:55 -0500] [frostschutz in #debian] err, EOF on yourfile.iso I guess
[2016-05-14 06:08:19 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] well. I dont think that is a good idea. I guess the world will go even worse and insane, hideous.
[2016-05-14 06:08:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: that page seems to refer to horribly old models and debian releases.
[2016-05-14 06:08:49 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ewew, nah, we just have to avoid stupid things
[2016-05-14 06:08:52 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] .evil
[2016-05-14 06:08:52 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] The world will not be destroyed by evil, but by man's own stupidity.
[2016-05-14 06:08:56 -0500] [guggu in #debian] frostschutz: thanks for the tip
[2016-05-14 06:08:57 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] e*10^9 seconds is the approximate upper bound of human lifespan
[2016-05-14 06:09:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: I'd probably use the debian installation guide
[2016-05-14 06:09:33 -0500] [guggu in #debian] although, it still seems unlikely to me that a mac book can boot from that
[2016-05-14 06:09:42 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: yeah that's not a good source of information.
[2016-05-14 06:09:45 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] The totalitary ideology today would be insane nightmare.
[2016-05-14 06:09:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian] !ig

[2016-05-14 06:09:51 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] no doubt.
[2016-05-14 06:10:00 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: i tried and i could not boot from that
[2016-05-14 06:10:18 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Wait, what is the topic now? I thought it was B vitamins and odd things living in my stomach
[2016-05-14 06:10:23 -0500] [guggu in #debian] now i re formatted the usb disk as a vfat

[2016-05-14 06:10:34 -0500] [guggu in #debian] and i'm trying again with cat instead of dd
[2016-05-14 06:10:36 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: from where are you doing the usb, osx?
[2016-05-14 06:10:45 -0500] [guggu in #debian] from linux now
[2016-05-14 06:10:56 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i launched dd from the mac earlier though
[2016-05-14 06:11:02 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Ok, start listing the conspiracy thepories....
[2016-05-14 06:11:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: there's no need to format it at all, the image is supposed to overwrite the whole device and provide its own partition table and filesystem format
[2016-05-14 06:11:18 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] puts on his alu-cap again
[2016-05-14 06:11:18 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] imagine the todays technology before 1989.
[2016-05-14 06:11:30 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] oh dear heavens it is so embarrasing using my mac at the moment. 8 gigs of ramd and the thing slows to a crawl when i have both FIrefox and Chrome running
[2016-05-14 06:11:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] most humans are just three kittens stacked with a trench coat.
[2016-05-14 06:11:44 -0500] [guggu in #debian] jelly: thanks A LOT, now im making more sense out of dd, cat and such
[2016-05-14 06:11:53 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks Get rid of it and get pc.
[2016-05-14 06:11:55 -0500] [jelly in #debian] if this is a laptop with wireless network, you may just go with firmware images right away

[2016-05-14 06:12:29 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] better from linux, in osx you have to do additional steps with diskutil
[2016-05-14 06:12:36 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] neglesaks, get a pi and safe some trees is all i can say ;)
[2016-05-14 06:12:50 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: as in http://osxdaily.com/2015/06/05/copy-iso-to-usb-drive-mac-os-x-command/
[2016-05-14 06:12:54 -0500] [guggu in #debian] which one do you suggest?
[2016-05-14 06:13:20 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] cp as jelly said
[2016-05-14 06:13:21 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Yeah im sitting here on a Debian-only workstation. The Mac I use for studies. I'll try uninstalling one of the kernel odules, it may be the outbound firewall...
[2016-05-14 06:13:24 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] and spend a few times more time o it.
[2016-05-14 06:13:31 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] pardong?
[2016-05-14 06:13:44 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: yea its just suggesting to use dd
[2016-05-14 06:13:59 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] refering to power saving systems.
[2016-05-14 06:13:59 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] use cp from linux if you can
[2016-05-14 06:14:25 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] dd is fine too I guess whatever floats your goat
[2016-05-14 06:14:33 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: k, ill try with that, any suggested options?
[2016-05-14 06:14:42 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] use cp heh
[2016-05-14 06:14:44 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] like now. The eu will ban kettle. For its high power need.
[2016-05-14 06:14:47 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: I mean, dd may be just fine as well but we don't know how dd from osx works and how it deals with that last partial write
[2016-05-14 06:15:05 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] nothing beats a rpi for that...  that performance/power
[2016-05-14 06:15:06 -0500] [jelly in #debian] we also do not know how osx cp works, either :-)
[2016-05-14 06:15:30 -0500] [guggu in #debian] that's why i'm trying to write the iso from linux now
[2016-05-14 06:15:36 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: from osx you need additional steps as I pasted above, if you have a linux machine just us cp
[2016-05-14 06:15:48 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] use*
[2016-05-14 06:16:21 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] way below 5W with normal use.
[2016-05-14 06:17:09 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Kettle? You mean a water boiler?
[2016-05-14 06:17:29 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i do have a linux machine, dont worry about writing iso files from mac os x
[2016-05-14 06:17:30 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] Im using an Intel NUC.... I think its 20 Watts when its runnign full blast. BUt I can barely hear it in use.
[2016-05-14 06:17:56 -0500] [guggu in #debian] i tried that before just to see if it were any difference, but the drive would not boot anyway, so im back on linux
[2016-05-14 06:18:04 -0500] [neglesaks in #debian-offtopic] I havbe some Lenovo THinkcentres. Very nice mini-workstations, but too noisy for typical use. And too noise for me to concentrate.
[2016-05-14 06:18:16 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle but powerd by electricity.
[2016-05-14 06:18:41 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] coworker says his mac mini does 7W idle and <10W playing video
[2016-05-14 06:19:05 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] and yeah, something like 20W if you really lean on it
[2016-05-14 06:19:14 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] well, that thing has basically a cellphone inside :3
[2016-05-14 06:19:52 -0500] [guggu in #debian] im currently trying cp (from linux) as you suggested to write the iso. ill let you know if it boots from the mac
[2016-05-14 06:19:59 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] there's a very decent intel inside, just one of the low power models for ultrabooks
[2016-05-14 06:20:08 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] thinks instead of the user.
[2016-05-14 06:20:15 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: whats the exact command you're using?
[2016-05-14 06:20:49 -0500] [guggu in #debian] just cp -v debian.iso /dev/sdc1
[2016-05-14 06:20:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] wrong
[2016-05-14 06:21:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: /dev/sdc not the partition
[2016-05-14 06:21:16 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] ^
[2016-05-14 06:21:24 -0500] [jelly in #debian] you want to overwrite the whole device
[2016-05-14 06:21:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] which is what install guide says
[2016-05-14 06:21:48 -0500] [guggu in #debian] whopsie daisy
[2016-05-14 06:21:55 -0500] [guggu in #debian] relauched
[2016-05-14 06:22:25 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] jelly: ah, the thing that looks like a NUC. Intel did a great thing with their M CPUs.
[2016-05-14 06:22:52 -0500] [guggu in #debian] my bad
[2016-05-14 06:22:59 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] or is it even M?
[2016-05-14 06:23:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] think it's some cpu model that ends with "u"
[2016-05-14 06:24:14 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] meh, all the official specs just say Intel i5/i7   yeah, thx....
[2016-05-14 06:24:56 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] i5-4260U or what not
[2016-05-14 06:25:08 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html has some details
[2016-05-14 06:25:31 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that's pretty neat.
[2016-05-14 06:25:37 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] Maybe they rely on fact that user does not care.
[2016-05-14 06:26:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ewew, probably not, the whole industrie is looking forward for more cycles and less power
[2016-05-14 06:26:43 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ewew, think mobile, IoT etc etc
[2016-05-14 06:27:05 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] but are they looking there because of hitting physical constraints, or because of actual market
[2016-05-14 06:27:09 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] IoT useless.
[2016-05-14 06:27:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, both
[2016-05-14 06:27:32 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] IoT stuff needs mW not 10W
[2016-05-14 06:27:33 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, they go hand in hand
[2016-05-14 06:28:15 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, 3d finfet brought some improvement, but fasten your seatbelts for more new stuff
[2016-05-14 06:28:18 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] if the power supply is bad design it will cause massive interference.
[2016-05-14 06:28:19 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] like zigbee or bt 4.1 connected sensors
[2016-05-14 06:28:42 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] put two AA bats :-) in, keep it running for a year
[2016-05-14 06:29:03 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] 8-bit MCUs ftw!
[2016-05-14 06:29:16 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] those things are fun. and used everywhere.
[2016-05-14 06:29:23 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, within a decade we will talk in milliwatt ranges not watts of TDP
[2016-05-14 06:29:38 -0500] [guggu in #debian] k, so the mac does not see the usb drive
[2016-05-14 06:29:54 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] and in 50 years, chips will start producing power while they compute!
[2016-05-14 06:30:18 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat, maybe, but you have to move like crazy ;)
[2016-05-14 06:30:29 -0500] [guggu in #debian] it doenst show up at boot when i press alt, and when i try to read it from mac os ox it says that the disk is not readable
[2016-05-14 06:30:59 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] maybe radiation will be stron enough to power your laptop.
[2016-05-14 06:31:35 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, not yet, but you can harvest it. Something in the range of a few 10's of milliwatts
[2016-05-14 06:32:02 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] but 50 years are long enough for two nuclear wars!
[2016-05-14 06:32:18 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, nah, like i said
[2016-05-14 06:32:20 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] .evil
[2016-05-14 06:32:20 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] The world will not be destroyed by evil, but by man's own stupidity.
[2016-05-14 06:32:36 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] but stupidity *is* evil
[2016-05-14 06:32:45 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] or accidental triggering of the nuclear reserves?
[2016-05-14 06:33:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] there are so manny, maybe one or two get dropped on accident in 50 years.
[2016-05-14 06:33:17 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat, thats to general, ask a monkey .... ;)
[2016-05-14 06:33:30 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] if someone brings the vulnerable IoT device in that room.
[2016-05-14 06:34:09 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ewew, ulp crypto computing and it will prolly be cpuless also
[2016-05-14 06:34:21 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] oops, pressed the wrong red button, thought it was a microwave, but it was the thermonuclear intercontinental rocket?
[2016-05-14 06:34:41 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, are you running fpr president? ;)
[2016-05-14 06:34:41 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] does some one knows a nice sweet grafical program environment for debian i want to code phyton and thats object orientated so i want object attribute compleation
[2016-05-14 06:34:53 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] maybe i should!
[2016-05-14 06:35:02 -0500] [guggu in #debian] vim and jedi-vim
[2016-05-14 06:35:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, mm.. maybe not so bad idea
[2016-05-14 06:35:14 -0500] [guggu in #debian] and an ipython shell on the side
[2016-05-14 06:35:28 -0500] [guggu in #debian] totally uncluttered and has everything you need
[2016-05-14 06:35:35 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] nah, politics is boring. i'll stick to CS :>
[2016-05-14 06:35:40 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] nah i hate politics too much .....
[2016-05-14 06:35:41 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] what should I ask a monkey
[2016-05-14 06:35:57 -0500] [guggu in #debian] or spyder, if youre not a vim fan
[2016-05-14 06:36:09 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat, hand me your banana if you like?
[2016-05-14 06:36:27 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] thats were it all started
[2016-05-14 06:36:36 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I don't wear bandanas
[2016-05-14 06:37:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] loooks into the bananorama opticles
[2016-05-14 06:38:01 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] hands dutchfish the banana phone
[2016-05-14 06:38:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] if we where a bit smarter we would never come down from the trees
[2016-05-14 06:38:16 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] ipython shell? i am not that into phyton yet i will check it out
[2016-05-14 06:38:26 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] thats how we lost eden ;)
[2016-05-14 06:38:50 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ah well
[2016-05-14 06:38:51 -0500] [guggu in #debian] yes, you run your code from there so you can debug and test stuff out
[2016-05-14 06:39:42 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] who was eden
[2016-05-14 06:40:15 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden
[2016-05-14 06:40:21 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] oke but how do i get function inside object sugestion..
[2016-05-14 06:40:35 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] how can you lose a garden
[2016-05-14 06:40:45 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] it can hardly fall behind the desk or something
[2016-05-14 06:40:53 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: so, yeah, the mac does not see the pendrive
[2016-05-14 06:41:15 -0500] [guggu in #debian] squidgirl: yes
[2016-05-14 06:41:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat, now thats a question .....
[2016-05-14 06:41:43 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch: I don't want to go but I will go
[2016-05-14 06:41:44 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] you can bet it in a game of cards and lose it?
[2016-05-14 06:42:07 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes: i'm sure you will look pretty in your dress :3
[2016-05-14 06:42:08 -0500] [guggu in #debian] squidgirl: automatically whenever you type a dot. you can also disable that and trigger it only with control space (im talking about jedi-vim)
[2016-05-14 06:42:09 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, nah, he talked to much to the snake ;)
[2016-05-14 06:42:25 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch: <3
[2016-05-14 06:42:45 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] oke thanks guggu i will check jedi-vim out
[2016-05-14 06:42:56 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch: I'll try to find me an Argentian tango dancer
[2016-05-14 06:42:57 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, have fun
[2016-05-14 06:43:00 -0500] [guggu in #debian] squidgirl: goes without saying, that works for your own classes as well.
[2016-05-14 06:43:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, are you are prolly smarter then us ;)
[2016-05-14 06:43:29 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes: damn, i've seen them last year. hot hot hot.
[2016-05-14 06:43:37 -0500] [guggu in #debian] squidgirl: if youre not familiar with vim, jedi vim is a plugin, which you should install via pathogen
[2016-05-14 06:43:37 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] thanks guggu thats just what i need..
[2016-05-14 06:43:46 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] yeah, but he's evil

[2016-05-14 06:43:57 -0500] [squidgirl in #debian] i know vim.
[2016-05-14 06:44:04 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, about the latin part, oh sure
[2016-05-14 06:44:10 -0500] [guggu in #debian] you're all set then
[2016-05-14 06:44:20 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: Do you want to speak about your problem?
[2016-05-14 06:44:34 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, sorry Dave, can't do that ;)
[2016-05-14 06:44:46 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes speaks latin?
[2016-05-14 06:45:19 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] isn't latin mandatory in berlin schools?
[2016-05-14 06:45:30 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] can't be
[2016-05-14 06:45:38 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] They didn't want me at a Berlin school
[2016-05-14 06:45:51 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i had to do latin for four years D:
[2016-05-14 06:46:22 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] mumbles 
[2016-05-14 06:46:23 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] Quanto magis didici oblitus
[2016-05-14 06:46:45 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I never got the hang of that
[2016-05-14 06:47:05 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I wanted to travel to latinia, to learn it better from native speakers
[2016-05-14 06:47:06 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] uhm.... romani ite domom.
[2016-05-14 06:47:10 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] anyway, ochiottes have fun!
[2016-05-14 06:47:13 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] * domum
[2016-05-14 06:47:35 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: I'm not leaving
[2016-05-14 06:47:36 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] but somehow that never worked out
[2016-05-14 06:49:03 -0500] [cdb23ax in #debian] hello i have a problem with xming and x11 forwarding
[2016-05-14 06:49:14 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] they acted real strange at the travel agency when I tried to book a flight to latinia
[2016-05-14 06:49:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, oh ok, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puN0ebZfT_k
[2016-05-14 06:49:17 -0500] [cdb23ax in #debian] iam using windows but i need the virt-manager for creating vms

[2016-05-14 06:49:54 -0500] [cdb23ax in #debian] i can open virt-manager without gui with x11 forwarding on my windows machine
[2016-05-14 06:50:14 -0500] [cdb23ax in #debian] as soon as i open the graphical console of one vm the program shuts down
[2016-05-14 06:50:20 -0500] [cdb23ax in #debian] it just closes
[2016-05-14 06:51:05 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] can anyone explain whathis does please?   perl -pe 's/^.*\s(\S+)\s*$/$1\n/' | sort | uniq -c
[2016-05-14 06:51:11 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thanks in advance
[2016-05-14 06:51:27 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: well maybe the 2.1 efi is old as hell and cannot boot a linux installer from usb, I can boot a debian usb stick in a 3.1 though
[2016-05-14 06:52:43 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: perhaps is related to the 32 bit efi. I dont know to be honest
[2016-05-14 06:54:03 -0500] [jelly in #debian] guggu: see if the normal image without firmware fails to boot as well, then ask in #debian-boot over on irc.oftc.net, maybe there's someone online available for help
[2016-05-14 06:55:04 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] guggu: also give a try to a good old cdrom if you can
[2016-05-14 06:55:10 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: ask in #perl if noone answers here
[2016-05-14 06:55:23 -0500] [hex0rcist in #debian] hello
[2016-05-14 06:55:33 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thanks Jelly
[2016-05-14 06:56:10 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: do you have some context where that line is supposed to be used?
[2016-05-14 06:56:39 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] had to study latin while i was doing biology, most of the nomenclature is greek/latin anyway, i mix.
[2016-05-14 06:57:07 -0500] [sexytime in #debian] :)
[2016-05-14 06:57:40 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: assuming there's some input piped to that oneliner, it appears to count the number of lines with matching last words in the line
[2016-05-14 06:58:01 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] where is ochiottes going anyway
[2016-05-14 06:58:10 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i can't remember anything i learned in school. it's just empty space.
[2016-05-14 06:58:44 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] multiplication table?
[2016-05-14 06:59:00 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] the thing with the numbers?
[2016-05-14 06:59:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] chaos theory?
[2016-05-14 06:59:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] they taught chaos theory in your school, dutchfish?
[2016-05-14 06:59:15 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] oh, it was chaotic, alright.
[2016-05-14 06:59:22 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, yes
[2016-05-14 06:59:31 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, yup :)
[2016-05-14 07:01:16 -0500] [guggu in #debian] teraflops: jelly: yeah the thing is, it doesnt even work when i just plug it in on osx
[2016-05-14 07:01:39 -0500] [guggu in #debian] of course i tested the disk on other machines and it works
[2016-05-14 07:01:55 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] I remember that I learned from our geography teacher how one doesn't ever acts as a teacher
[2016-05-14 07:01:58 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, if i rem it correctly it was in as an extension of entropic systems
[2016-05-14 07:02:13 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, but it is a long time ago
[2016-05-14 07:02:55 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] jelly, also brownian movement stuff
[2016-05-14 07:03:32 -0500] [guggu in #debian] http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2034955 probably related
[2016-05-14 07:05:25 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] but i can vividly remember how i hated all the math .....
[2016-05-14 07:05:56 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] jelly: sorry i was at the #perl, Thank you
[2016-05-14 07:06:06 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] well i saw that line lomg time ago somewhere
[2016-05-14 07:06:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i learned to love it in uni.
[2016-05-14 07:06:17 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] and i always wante dto know what it does
[2016-05-14 07:06:25 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, i was never good at math
[2016-05-14 07:06:59 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] jelly:
[2016-05-14 07:08:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] you can't have it all ....
[2016-05-14 07:08:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] yep x)
[2016-05-14 07:08:45 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] damn I can not paste
[2016-05-14 07:09:01 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: it's probably just a quick oneliner that solves someone's immediate issue.  You can do similar stuff if you learn a bit about regular expressions and some scripting language that supports them (awk, perl, python, probably even bash)
[2016-05-14 07:10:36 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] CS has so much math in it. 4 Semester pure math, then all the theoretical CS which is just math but in green, a few semesters numerical analysis. much fun x)
[2016-05-14 07:10:54 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] bleh
[2016-05-14 07:12:00 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thank you jelly
[2016-05-14 07:12:08 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] ye stheres is a first part to that
[2016-05-14 07:12:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] the fun thing with math and me is, once i can visualize it, i can understand it, i can do that with extremely complex things, no sweat. But when it comes down to formal math, its getting mystical to me,
[2016-05-14 07:12:23 -0500] [jelly in #debian] awk has some builtin functionality that makes it a lot easier to do the same thing
[2016-05-14 07:12:43 -0500] [jelly in #debian] you could replace the perl s/// segment with just awk '{print $NF}'
[2016-05-14 07:13:22 -0500] [Waxhead in #debian] I do not tamper with my sources.list much , however I have mirrored debian locally on a server and if I add both my server url + for example httpredir.debian.org/debian/ stretch..... aptitude seems to prefer the httpredir when downloading. I am on a very slow network and mirroring happens during night. How can I configure it so my local url will be preferred UNLESS newer packages are found in httpredir... ?!
[2016-05-14 07:13:37 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] the first part is tail -50000  somepath/daemon.log | grep "failed to remove" |perl.......
[2016-05-14 07:14:16 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] i get this in debioan paste
[2016-05-14 07:14:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Waxhead: if exactly the same packages with exactly the same priority are found in multiple configured repos, I _think_ the order in sources.list is used
[2016-05-14 07:14:51 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] thanks to some spammers you need to provide at least 2 linebreaks
[2016-05-14 07:14:56 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] what does it mean?
[2016-05-14 07:15:07 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: context?
[2016-05-14 07:15:25 -0500] [Waxhead in #debian] jelly: alrighty ... then I will just swap the order and see what happens :)
[2016-05-14 07:15:27 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] I was trying to paste the whole line
[2016-05-14 07:15:33 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] and pressinf send
[2016-05-14 07:15:44 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] i got that in debian.paste.net
[2016-05-14 07:15:50 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: oh, the silly pastebin wants you to paste more than one line
[2016-05-14 07:15:55 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] what are linebreaks?
[2016-05-14 07:16:01 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] oh
[2016-05-14 07:16:21 -0500] [jelly in #debian] linebreak is what ends a line, a control character
[2016-05-14 07:17:38 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] paste.debian.net/683854
[2016-05-14 07:17:55 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Waxhead: try to "apt-cache policy somepackage" and see if the version and the priority value from your local mirror is the same as the remote mirror
[2016-05-14 07:19:04 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: so it counts occurences of words from last few matching lines of that log file
[2016-05-14 07:19:08 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] hi
[2016-05-14 07:19:36 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] i prolly just was wired up wrongly, i dunno ....
[2016-05-14 07:19:44 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] i've removed chromium using apt-get remove chromium and it left some process actives, is it normal? i have multiples process like this one "/usr/lib/chromium/chromium"
[2016-05-14 07:19:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: if you want to analyze what a complex pipe oneliner does, you can remove one by one pipe segment and look at what the rest does
[2016-05-14 07:20:03 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] OK Thanks Jelly
[2016-05-14 07:20:16 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] (within the context of math)
[2016-05-14 07:20:17 -0500] [jelly in #debian] append | less if there's lots of output
[2016-05-14 07:20:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: thus: tail  -50000 /apps/IP/IPcenterJ/logs/ipradar_daemon.log  | less
[2016-05-14 07:20:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] nah, i get it. math can be tiring if you don't have a practical application for it.
[2016-05-14 07:20:40 -0500] [jelly in #debian] and see what it does
[2016-05-14 07:21:00 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: then: tail  -50000 /apps/IP/IPcenterJ/logs/ipradar_daemon.log | grep "failed to remove ack" | less
[2016-05-14 07:21:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] like calculus. it get taught all wrong.
[2016-05-14 07:21:13 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, oh i had many times. It just doesn't stick ...
[2016-05-14 07:21:24 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: and see what's the difference and what's cut out from the output and what's left
[2016-05-14 07:21:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] and so on
[2016-05-14 07:21:39 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Cool thanks
[2016-05-14 07:22:19 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] once, i asked how mixers work in RF aplications, i got tons of math handed to me, but noone could explain how they work, it took me a week to figure it out.
[2016-05-14 07:22:50 -0500] [jelly in #debian] x-fak: you'll have to quit the browser or kill the processes in some way.  Removing the installation does not stop them.
[2016-05-14 07:23:06 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] you mean fourier transform?
[2016-05-14 07:23:13 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] jelly , alright i see
[2016-05-14 07:23:15 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, yes, and more
[2016-05-14 07:23:41 -0500] [jelly in #debian] in general, removing a package only stops things if it was a service package, not normal apps
[2016-05-14 07:23:44 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, like FFT
[2016-05-14 07:23:51 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that one too. it's so easy to understand once i makes click. but it has a steep learning curve.
[2016-05-14 07:24:02 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] nods
[2016-05-14 07:24:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] now its easy
[2016-05-14 07:24:08 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] jelly pkill chromium and it's done
[2016-05-14 07:24:17 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] because i can visualize it now
[2016-05-14 07:24:48 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] it took some time for me to understand what it means to transform signals to the frequency domain.
[2016-05-14 07:25:12 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] but there is some good literature. one just has to find the time.

[2016-05-14 07:25:21 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] yup
[2016-05-14 07:25:45 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] how can i update my softwares which ive now??

[2016-05-14 07:27:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] ha
[2016-05-14 07:28:26 -0500] [stoned in #debian] :)
[2016-05-14 07:28:28 -0500] [jelly in #debian] bazhang: might want to /msg dpkg somefactoid first to verify it's the thing a user actually asked
[2016-05-14 07:28:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, once you fully understand recursion to all its extends, its easy.
[2016-05-14 07:29:15 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: it covers for example former grammer. for example the grammar that creates the language of all correct arithmetic formulas. stuff that is important for compilers.
[2016-05-14 07:29:17 -0500] [bazhang in #debian] jelly, I might at that
[2016-05-14 07:29:26 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: That was Mittermeier's attempt at going back to the roots

[2016-05-14 07:29:44 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Any kind of trippy visualization software in debian?
[2016-05-14 07:29:49 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Not music based, but stand alone
[2016-05-14 07:29:51 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, thats heavy stuff :)
[2016-05-14 07:30:13 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Not like an audio player plugin
[2016-05-14 07:30:25 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: yeah, u-recursive computability as an alternative to touring computability is a topic too x)
[2016-05-14 07:30:29 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, most assemblers were created the other way around ;)
[2016-05-14 07:30:37 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Doesn't have to go bumping w/ the music, just visualizations. Crazy fractals trippy stuffs. Mandlebrot maybe
[2016-05-14 07:30:49 -0500] [weilancys in #debian] will writing iso images to a flashdisk with dd too many times damage the disk?
[2016-05-14 07:30:56 -0500] [stoned in #debian] weilancys: no
[2016-05-14 07:31:11 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, that didn't fit in my brain back then ;)
[2016-05-14 07:31:20 -0500] [stoned in #debian] weilancys: eventually of course (after a long while) you'll exhaust your flash cells
[2016-05-14 07:32:08 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, i finally got it, when doing some stuff in FORTH
[2016-05-14 07:32:48 -0500] [weilancys in #debian] I bought a new ssd with its instruction manual saying the user should avoid benchmark testing the ssd too many times. So I wonder if it's true.
[2016-05-14 07:33:13 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, good luck with that btw
[2016-05-14 07:33:29 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: heh, thx :3
[2016-05-14 07:33:37 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] understanding compilers is great
[2016-05-14 07:33:49 -0500] [weilancys in #debian] I thought benchmark tests do the same with dd, as they all do multiple writes and reads to the disk. Am I right?
[2016-05-14 07:34:11 -0500] [weilancys in #debian] thanks, stoned for your answer.
[2016-05-14 07:35:14 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian-offtopic] ochiottes, he has roots?
[2016-05-14 07:35:21 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Don't benchmark ssd (unless it's for testing purposes or a quick speed test on the read/write)
[2016-05-14 07:35:29 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Dont' defrag ssd either (rule #1)
[2016-05-14 07:35:33 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] srry guys for being away,bad net
[2016-05-14 07:35:35 -0500] [karlpinc in #debian] stoned: There's a mandelbrot screen saver.  Somewhere.
[2016-05-14 07:35:36 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] still alot is missing when you go back to those roots, but we discuss that later once you have chewned it bit more on it. Intresting things.
[2016-05-14 07:35:42 -0500] [stoned in #debian] hey karl

[2016-05-14 07:35:53 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] dutchfish: i used this stuff once to create a regex that checks if a payload is valid IPP or not. it's pretty cool what you can do with the language types in the chomsky hirarchy.
[2016-05-14 07:35:56 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] whats the command to update software??

[2016-05-14 07:36:15 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] apt-get update && apt-get upgrade??
[2016-05-14 07:36:16 -0500] [stoned in #debian] MaBunny: apt-get update; apt-get upgrade;
[2016-05-14 07:36:24 -0500] [stoned in #debian] indeed
[2016-05-14 07:36:28 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, keep it strong typed and you will do fine ;)

[2016-05-14 07:39:06 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Desc. is appealing. I'll check it today
[2016-05-14 07:39:12 -0500] [bazhang in #debian] ok

[2016-05-14 07:40:10 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that's cool. i came as far as how the pipeline works, then with error detection in the pipeline and the other complex stuff was too much for me.
[2016-05-14 07:40:23 -0500] [karlpinc in #debian] stoned: debtags is very helpful.  Especially after you find one program you can use it's tags to find similar things.
[2016-05-14 07:40:40 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Ok
[2016-05-14 07:40:41 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, right, i tried it before, but gave up back then, but i am determined now.

[2016-05-14 07:42:57 -0500] [stoned in #debian] http://sprunge.us/JCTH <- MaBunny take a peek at this apt automation
[2016-05-14 07:43:02 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] maybe you can use swap space???
[2016-05-14 07:43:10 -0500] [stoned in #debian] You should compress your ram
[2016-05-14 07:43:15 -0500] [MaBunny in #debian] ok stoned
[2016-05-14 07:43:16 -0500] [stoned in #debian] There are two options
[2016-05-14 07:43:19 -0500] [stoned in #debian] zwap and/or zram
[2016-05-14 07:43:39 -0500] [stoned in #debian] I have 4x 512mb zram devices
[2016-05-14 07:43:52 -0500] [stoned in #debian] And I think I'll switch over to zswap b/c lately I'm suffering LRU inversion
[2016-05-14 07:44:10 -0500] [stoned in #debian] My zram devices get fulll and then new data gets pages to slower HDD
[2016-05-14 07:44:28 -0500] [stoned in #debian] And now my zram devices contain old data, they're full so new pages get pushed to the next devices
[2016-05-14 07:44:39 -0500] [stoned in #debian] once my zrams are full, things get slow. I think I'll check out zwap
[2016-05-14 07:44:42 -0500] [stoned in #debian] zswap
[2016-05-14 07:45:37 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] teraflops , i ask this because i have 1GB of RAM, and it's noted free 999Mb
[2016-05-14 07:45:46 -0500] [zuzzas_ in #debian] Hey, guys. What do you use to monitor package changes (as in NEWS and changelos changes) on a large deployments? I've used "apt-listchanges", but I have no idea how to make it scale, so our team isn't overrun by tons of emails after each "apt upgrade".
[2016-05-14 07:46:40 -0500] [don_armstrong in #debian] zuzzas_: usually on large deployments you have a master image which runs in testing which you watch and track, and none of the deployed machines run apt-listchanges
[2016-05-14 07:48:04 -0500] [zuzzas_ in #debian] don_armstrong: yeah, that makes sense. thanks!
[2016-05-14 07:48:15 -0500] [dondelelcaro in #debian] (mainly because by the time you actually deploy it into production, it's too late to be reading the NEWS and changelogs)

[2016-05-14 08:06:04 -0500] [stoned in #debian] x-fak: aliased to 'upgrade' in bashrc. Look at the script.
[2016-05-14 08:06:19 -0500] [stoned in #debian] x-fak: 2nd script is zram setup (read about zram)
[2016-05-14 08:06:32 -0500] [stoned in #debian] x-fak: third is clearin stale ram caches

[2016-05-14 08:08:19 -0500] [stoned in #debian] But you can use it too if you want. It's handy
[2016-05-14 08:09:12 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] stoned , ok i will call it upgrade.sh
[2016-05-14 08:09:31 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Read the script anbd don't run it blindly
[2016-05-14 08:09:45 -0500] [stoned in #debian] It also removes stale configs and couple other things it does you may or may not want
[2016-05-14 08:10:15 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] stoned , it's not like i am an APT guru
[2016-05-14 08:10:22 -0500] [stoned in #debian] You should becoem one.

[2016-05-14 08:17:19 -0500] [stoned in #debian] john-soda: you might also want apt-listbugs and apt-listchanges while using testing

[2016-05-14 08:18:00 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Yup
[2016-05-14 08:18:07 -0500] [stoned in #debian] OS: Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64/x86_64-Distro: Debian 8.4-CPU: 4 x Intel Core2 Quad (3775.102 MHz)-Processes: 652-Uptime: 8d 20h 16m-Users: 4-Load Average: 0.37-Memory Usage: 2013.92MB/8002.51MB (-197.36%)-Disk Usage: 3379.53GB/3734.40GB (90.50%)
[2016-05-14 08:18:20 -0500] [stoned in #debian] So I have 8GB ram, and a quad core cpu
[2016-05-14 08:18:45 -0500] [stoned in #debian] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram <- read this
[2016-05-14 08:19:36 -0500] [stoned in #debian] So the script loads the zram module and setups 4 zram devices, 512 mb each.
[2016-05-14 08:19:53 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Once you read about zram the script will become crystal clear.
[2016-05-14 08:21:03 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Also read about how to setup linux swap spaces as that's what zram script is doing w/ the mkswap and swapon. Instead of creating a swap file or partition, it takes a bit of ram and uses that as a swap ramdisk, compressed.

[2016-05-14 08:49:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] stoned: I found 1:1 up to 1:1.5 of RAM:zram size still works well on a workstation.  So if you have 8GB RAM, set something like 2x4GB or 4x2GB zram with swap on it
[2016-05-14 08:49:58 -0500] [CutMeOwnThroat in #debian] JyZyXEL, you need to automate it somehow with cron etc

[2016-05-14 08:51:53 -0500] [stoned in #debian] jelly: according to what I read on forums etc. and the documentation, I figure this might be best. But I'll 2x2gb on 2 cores
[2016-05-14 08:52:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian] multimedia gets skippy even with zram swapping if you have as many zram devs as cpu cores

[2016-05-14 09:11:32 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sadmagic: so, how about logging in and inspecting what happened as the prompt suggests?
[2016-05-14 09:11:33 -0500] [Brigo in #debian-es] de todas formas, la ayuda de mysql, incluso online es muy buena.
[2016-05-14 09:11:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] but i'm not going to help him with that kind of attitude.
[2016-05-14 09:11:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jelly.
[2016-05-14 09:11:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jml2: if you're not going to help, just keep quiet
[2016-05-14 09:12:15 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jelly, well you help him then. and take the profanity then.
[2016-05-14 09:12:44 -0500] [stoned in #debian] That happend with me once on an ntfs disk. wouln't mount my 2gb green ntfs backup disk. Kept going on in a loop. I rebooted into single user mode, commented out the fstab line for the device, rebooted into the machine, was fine. Rebooted to window, scandisk, fix ntfs errors, remount in linux, works again
[2016-05-14 09:12:44 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] you take it jml2

[2016-05-14 09:12:51 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] take it
[2016-05-14 09:12:55 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] sadmagic, anyway, had the same bullcrap and turned out i didnt have some features systemd needed in my kernel.
[2016-05-14 09:13:00 -0500] [themill in #debian] sadmagic, jml2: enough, thanks.
[2016-05-14 09:13:11 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] toruvinn, the link you posted?
[2016-05-14 09:13:16 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] is that all I need?
[2016-05-14 09:13:18 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] it can't be!
[2016-05-14 09:13:23 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] If so, praise god
[2016-05-14 09:13:26 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] sadmagic, yeah the debian.org one, it links to upstream readme too, which is what you want even more i guess
[2016-05-14 09:13:36 -0500] [hiya in #debian] how to view the bottom notification bar?
[2016-05-14 09:13:52 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sadmagic: are you using a custom kernel?  Which debian release is this?  Are you able to log in at that prompt at all?
[2016-05-14 09:14:01 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] toruvinn, I will give it a shot now. going forward I'm avoiding systems with system fucking sucking the d
[2016-05-14 09:14:04 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] sadmagic, if you use jessie's distro kernel then everything's in there already... however, you apparently don't.

[2016-05-14 09:14:37 -0500] [themill in #debian] sadmagic: drop the attitude, last request.
[2016-05-14 09:14:43 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] which is why i still have wheezy here and there.
[2016-05-14 09:14:55 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sadmagic: show the output of "journalctl -xb"
[2016-05-14 09:14:56 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] toruvinn, thumbs up for you buddy
[2016-05-14 09:15:13 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] jelly, he can't boot, how can he run journalctl? ;^)
[2016-05-14 09:15:32 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] jelly, i'm almost entirely sure it's lacking kernel options compiled in, really, had the same thing.
[2016-05-14 09:15:51 -0500] [stoned in #debian] sadmagic: ssytemd is an elusive beast.
[2016-05-14 09:15:52 -0500] [jelly in #debian] toruvinn: look at the screenshot.
[2016-05-14 09:16:03 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] jelly, yes, i am looking at https://imgur.com/a/kUfj5

[2016-05-14 09:20:58 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] There are exactly two things I dislike: McDonalds ads and the football team of Stuttgart. And the latter is about to be relegated in less than 60 minutes from now. I'm counting the seconds for maximum pleasure
[2016-05-14 09:21:16 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] jelly, i remember having exactly the same problem quite some time ago, when dist-upgrading wheezy -> jess, had my own custom kernel IIRC without automounter compiled in. ended up exactly the same, systemd's fsck "forever" until it fails, maintenance login prompt which... im not entirely sure it worked at all.
[2016-05-14 09:21:24 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] hopefully it's the same problem.
[2016-05-14 09:21:36 -0500] [ompaul in #debian-offtopic] decides not to give TomTomTosch lesson in the subtlety of the different dialects of English.
[2016-05-14 09:21:38 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] sadly i think i deleted my kvm screengrabs from back then
[2016-05-14 09:22:17 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] kinda funny cause i went through the KERNEL REQUIREMENTS list, but i still missed one option somehow...
[2016-05-14 09:22:40 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] took 2 hours of comparing .config from distro and my custom to figure things out :-/

[2016-05-14 09:25:40 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Haha
[2016-05-14 09:26:54 -0500] [jelly in #debian] toruvinn: it's not the fsck service here, it's bringing up md0
[2016-05-14 09:27:11 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] All this jokes about debian and systemd with no reasoning. This is a reflection of your own ignorance
[2016-05-14 09:27:49 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] heh 'systemd messed up my raid' - I wonder how that could be possible
[2016-05-14 09:28:01 -0500] [jelly in #debian] there are valid technical reasons to whine about systemd, but it TELLS the admin what to do next right there on the console...
[2016-05-14 09:28:36 -0500] [SirLagz in #debian] does systemd eventually start the system if /etc/network/interfaces is setup incorrectly?
[2016-05-14 09:29:03 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sadmagic: so if you're willing to stick to tech support, and provide info when asked for, you can do that.  Keep the frustrated comments out of the channel, please.
[2016-05-14 09:29:07 -0500] [ompaul_ in #debian] SirLagz: there is a timeout for pretty much everything.
[2016-05-14 09:29:24 -0500] [SirLagz in #debian] ompaul_: I guess I didn't wait long enough then
[2016-05-14 09:32:29 -0500] [jelly in #debian] ompaul_: sometimes the timeout is 40+ minutes
[2016-05-14 09:32:31 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Systemd default timeout for units is 90 secs if I remember it correctly
[2016-05-14 09:33:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian] i suspect the ifupdown interactions will be solved by moving to systemd's network setup in stretch
[2016-05-14 09:33:39 -0500] [SirLagz in #debian] jelly: 40 minutes seems pretty broken lol
[2016-05-14 09:33:41 -0500] [stoned in #debian] teraflops: I don't mind either way. It's whatever. systemd/sysv whatever. It's all the same to me
[2016-05-14 09:33:46 -0500] [SirLagz in #debian] jelly: especially if it stops a system from starting up
[2016-05-14 09:34:09 -0500] [stoned in #debian] The learning curve of the new thing can be frustrating/annoying for some but that's easly overcome
[2016-05-14 09:34:16 -0500] [jelly in #debian] SirLagz: it's hard to report it when my desktop is half between jessie and stretch
[2016-05-14 09:34:27 -0500] [jelly in #debian] so I didn't
[2016-05-14 09:34:45 -0500] [SirLagz in #debian] jelly: if I try it again, I'll let you know how long it takes with a buggered interfaces file lol
[2016-05-14 09:36:19 -0500] [jelly in #debian] at least sadmagic has iLO so they can boot a rescue .iso if they're incapable of using systemd's emergency shell
[2016-05-14 09:36:48 -0500] [toogley in #debian] where should i put a *.desktop file of a __manual__ installed application? i want it to appear in the xfce4 menu.
[2016-05-14 09:37:12 -0500] [jelly in #debian] toogley: ~/.local/share/applications/ maybe?
[2016-05-14 09:38:41 -0500] [toogley in #debian] jelly: thanks
[2016-05-14 09:39:03 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] toogley: /usr/share/applications may also work if it is a system-wide installed one
[2016-05-14 09:40:11 -0500] [jelly in #debian] hexnewbie: ITYM /usr/local/share/applications
[2016-05-14 09:40:29 -0500] [jelly in #debian] /usr is prefix for packaged stuff
[2016-05-14 09:40:44 -0500] [ompaul_ in #debian] jelly: I've seen 1 minute 30
[2016-05-14 09:41:39 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] toogley: Or what jelly says. I was going to suggest /usr/local/share/applications, but I was confused by the directory not existing on my system.
[2016-05-14 09:41:48 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] 90 secs

[2016-05-14 09:57:38 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] systemd is probably why Ian killed himself too.
[2016-05-14 09:57:40 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] sadmagic, so the mods give you another chance and now i think you really crossed the line
[2016-05-14 09:57:44 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] unbelievable
[2016-05-14 09:57:50 -0500] [polyzen in #debian] wat
[2016-05-14 09:58:12 -0500] [stoned in #debian] misdirected anger and hatred.
[2016-05-14 09:58:19 -0500] [stoned in #debian] I feel bad for sadmagic
[2016-05-14 09:58:21 -0500] [polyzen in #debian] hands out popcorn
[2016-05-14 09:58:22 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] jml2, go to bed you little weirdo
[2016-05-14 09:58:45 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] wow so disgusting
[2016-05-14 09:58:54 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] systemd is the cancer that killed linux
[2016-05-14 09:59:00 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian] sadmagic, stop that, please.
[2016-05-14 09:59:13 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] there was a dream I once had
[2016-05-14 09:59:34 -0500] [polyzen in #debian] jelly ^
[2016-05-14 09:59:34 -0500] [stoned in #debian] I have a dream.. that one day, people won't be assholes to each other.
[2016-05-14 09:59:41 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] In this dream, I had a vision of a system that worked out of the box
[2016-05-14 09:59:43 -0500] [stoned in #debian] But that remains to be a dream.
[2016-05-14 09:59:50 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] this dream was real
[2016-05-14 09:59:54 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] I was living that dream
[2016-05-14 10:00:09 -0500] [zuzzas_ in #debian] Why are you responding to him?
[2016-05-14 10:00:09 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Debian has kept me happy since 2001
[2016-05-14 10:00:11 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] until systemd came along and fucked me in the ass and killed the system
[2016-05-14 10:00:15 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] I wonder why #debian is a troll magnet
[2016-05-14 10:00:24 -0500] [sadmagic in #debian] I'm not a fucking troll
[2016-05-14 10:00:27 -0500] [themill in #debian] sadmagic: you've had your chance and you apparently don't want help
[2016-05-14 10:00:30 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] sadmagic: I am pretty sure that was ALSA
[2016-05-14 10:00:42 -0500] [stoned in #debian] It's not. He's just having a bad day and taking his anger out on debian and venting in here. He'll grow up eventually.
[2016-05-14 10:00:44 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] themill, we love you
[2016-05-14 10:00:55 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] really he was given another chance
[2016-05-14 10:00:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] that went way too far
[2016-05-14 10:01:08 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] sheesh
[2016-05-14 10:01:12 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Free Will is an illusion.
[2016-05-14 10:01:24 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Retributivist mindsets are detrimetnal to humanity.
[2016-05-14 10:01:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] i hate it when people come on like this
[2016-05-14 10:01:34 -0500] [polyzen in #debian] plot twist: he's in his 40ps
[2016-05-14 10:01:35 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] ruins the whole irc experience
[2016-05-14 10:01:35 -0500] [polyzen in #debian] 40s*
[2016-05-14 10:01:52 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] stoned: heh
[2016-05-14 10:01:57 -0500] [stoned in #debian] Mine's not ruined. I didn't let it. You shouldn't either
[2016-05-14 10:05:23 -0500] [ewew in #debian-offtopic] one line patch. well. it happens.
[2016-05-14 10:07:09 -0500] [toogley in #debian] hexnewbie: yeah. i'm satisfied with the .local variant, thanks :D
[2016-05-14 10:21:55 -0500] [mapm in #debian] hello, I have a debian 8 in a lenovo X11, and I have a problem with the sound: I can only have one program at once producing sound. I have an "~/.asoundrc" like this: pcm.!hdmi {

[2016-05-14 10:23:31 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] mapm: is there any reason for not using pulseaudio there?
[2016-05-14 10:24:03 -0500] [stoned in #debian] http://sprunge.us/VZeH here's my .asoundrc
[2016-05-14 10:24:16 -0500] [stoned in #debian] look at it for example and setup dmix
[2016-05-14 10:24:34 -0500] [mapm in #debian] JohnDoh, I don't know pulseaudio!
[2016-05-14 10:25:34 -0500] [mapm in #debian] stoned, thank you I'll use this
[2016-05-14 10:25:49 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] mapm: If you aren't using PulseAudio, you might need to enable the dmix plugin in ALSA instead.  It's automatically enabled IIRC, but that might not happen when you're using a manual card specification.
[2016-05-14 10:26:00 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] mapm: PulseAudio would be easier, though

[2016-05-14 10:26:43 -0500] [nbilou in #debian] Hi, I'm looking for the iwlwifi-7265, 13 to 17. Does anyone know where I can find them ? This link https://packages.debian.org/fr/sid/firmware-iwlwifi provides some, but not all
[2016-05-14 10:26:59 -0500] [stoned in #debian] https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio
[2016-05-14 10:27:09 -0500] [mapm in #debian] thank you guys, now I have some good tracks to follow
[2016-05-14 10:38:42 -0500] [John[Lisbeth] in #debian] +
[2016-05-14 10:39:32 -0500] [hmir in #debian] Hi guys. I just ran the memtest option from the boot drive from the debian live cd. My question is, what am I supposed to get on the display? Right now my screen is blank.
[2016-05-14 10:39:42 -0500] [hmir in #debian] And numlock does not turn on and off.
[2016-05-14 10:40:18 -0500] [toogley in #debian] Johntitor: i think alsa is more simple than pulseaudio, which means i would always prefer alsa, unless i had to use pulseaudio for a reason
[2016-05-14 10:40:19 -0500] [hmir in #debian] But if I press ctrl+alt+del it will reboot after a whole bunch of text on screen, so clearly it's not crashed. So I want to know what kind of screen output should I get while it runs the test?
[2016-05-14 10:40:46 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] toogley: it's the other way around
[2016-05-14 10:41:18 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] hmir: A blue screen with a lot of text on it, displaying what is being tested, grouped in several pseudographics boxes, with errors in the bottom (red if any)
[2016-05-14 10:41:47 -0500] [toogley in #debian] Johntitor: i thought pulseaudio was client server ?
[2016-05-14 10:41:48 -0500] [hmir in #debian] shit, all i have is a blank screen. =(
[2016-05-14 10:42:06 -0500] [hmir in #debian] And, I don't think my mem is bad, I just did it on the spur of th emomemnt really.
[2016-05-14 10:43:19 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] toogley: puldeaudio just run at top of alsa making things more friendly
[2016-05-14 10:43:47 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] Runs*
[2016-05-14 10:44:11 -0500] [jelly in #debian] when hdmi audio does not work, it's much easier to debug and get running without PA in the way
[2016-05-14 10:45:48 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] hola
[2016-05-14 10:45:49 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] His/her sound is working, just lacking software mixing from what I gather.
[2016-05-14 10:45:56 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] alguien ha trabajado alguna vez con postgresql ?
[2016-05-14 10:46:14 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] hola desde uruguay, conozco pero poco
[2016-05-14 10:46:41 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] digamos instalacion, y cree alguna base, no soy un dba
[2016-05-14 10:46:41 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] en un select * from tabla, se puede poner por ejemplo : select max(*),* from tabla ;=
[2016-05-14 10:46:51 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: ni yo soy dba
[2016-05-14 10:47:12 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] pero es por que necessito el número maximo de filas devueltos por una select ...
[2016-05-14 10:47:34 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] y no se si se puede meter en un solo select o debo meterlo en otro select a parte
[2016-05-14 10:47:59 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] que yo sepa max en sql en general te devuelve el maximo de lo que le pases como paramtero no podes colocarle un .*
[2016-05-14 10:48:02 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] (mucho de debian no tiene, pero bueno :S)
[2016-05-14 10:48:30 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: me refiero a que tengo una tabla, vale ?
[2016-05-14 10:48:32 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] para eso tenes count si mal no revierdo
[2016-05-14 10:48:37 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] recuerdo*
[2016-05-14 10:48:43 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] en la que tengo nombre, apellido, etc ...
[2016-05-14 10:48:52 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] selec count(*) from tabla
[2016-05-14 10:49:15 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] y quiero recoguer todos los datos que tengo en dicha table y a la vez, el numero maximo de filas que hay, cosa que no se si es possible o no
[2016-05-14 10:49:22 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] mmmm
[2016-05-14 10:49:30 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] podria ponerlo en un where ?
[2016-05-14 10:49:50 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] no tiene mucho sentido lo que propones
[2016-05-14 10:49:53 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] por ejemplo : select * from tabla filas ="select count(*) from tabla" ?
[2016-05-14 10:50:11 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] por ejemplo : select * from tabla where filas ="select count(*) from tabla" ?
[2016-05-14 10:50:22 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] y filas me deberia de guardar el numero maximo de filas, no ?
[2016-05-14 10:50:24 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] poneme en pantalla un ejemplo de lo que querrias como salida
[2016-05-14 10:50:36 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] This is the second time I've had this happen
[2016-05-14 10:50:40 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: no te entiendo
[2016-05-14 10:51:04 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] How can I prevent this from happening in the future?  Just a simple power loss and I had to run fsck which some how ended up with over 13,000 files in /lost+found
[2016-05-14 10:51:12 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] mostrame un ejemplo de resultado que querrias que te de el select que necesitas construir

[2016-05-14 10:52:05 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] este no es el resultado que deseo! :S
[2016-05-14 10:52:16 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] este numero, le quiero añadir otra parte
[2016-05-14 10:52:36 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] dibujalo asi lo entiendo mostrame elresultado que querrias ver
[2016-05-14 10:53:02 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] si lo que vos queres saber es la cantidad de telefonos que tenes en una tabla
[2016-05-14 10:53:23 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] select count(*) from telefons;

[2016-05-14 10:53:57 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: aqui lo explico un poco
[2016-05-14 10:54:19 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] nezZario: which filesystem?
[2016-05-14 10:54:20 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: de una parte si ... pero tambien quiero recoguer todos los datos de la tabla con el mismo select, si es possible
[2016-05-14 10:55:03 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] ext4 sitting on mdadm
[2016-05-14 10:55:32 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] yea, ext4: /dev/md1 on / type ext4 (rw,noatime,nodiratime,discard,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
[2016-05-14 10:55:38 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] el paste bin el ultimo me estas mostrando datos de un registro de la tabla telefons
[2016-05-14 10:55:45 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] You mean sw raid?
[2016-05-14 10:55:47 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] si
[2016-05-14 10:55:52 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] en esta table ...
[2016-05-14 10:56:06 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] ahora ya, por decir un número aproximado, 118 registros
[2016-05-14 10:56:09 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] correct...don't think that has any bearing on it but just for disclosure
[2016-05-14 10:56:42 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] y yo he pensado en recoguer el numero maximo de registros y todos sus valores con una sola comanda select ... cosa que no se si es possible
[2016-05-14 10:56:45 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] porque si tenes 118 telefonos que aparezca al lado de cada registros: 118 |  4 | Marc...
[2016-05-14 10:56:51 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] no tiene mucho sentido
[2016-05-14 10:57:07 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] no no
[2016-05-14 10:57:30 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] calisto1: necessito el número total de registros para poder paginarlos con un scroll o lo que sea ...
[2016-05-14 10:57:31 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] si yo estuviera progamando no lo aria
[2016-05-14 10:57:57 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] el select tiene una sentencia limit
[2016-05-14 10:57:57 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] se me ha ocurrido esta manera ... y queria probar a ver que tal iba
[2016-05-14 10:58:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] nezZario, i read if you add a "bitmap" to the mdadm raid it helps alot of having to do large resyncs, i'm not sure if that can help with corruption loss but it might add some other benefit --- I know that power-outage is hell for any storage electronics because the bio needs to be flushed ... You can shorten the bio-flush times --- (i suppose you might be thinking of a ups, that too helps a lot)
[2016-05-14 10:58:11 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] si ...
[2016-05-14 10:58:28 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] que podes decirle mandame de la 0  a la 25 de la 26 a la 50 de la 50 a la 75 ... etc
[2016-05-14 10:58:31 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] pero con limit como puedo saber las paginas que tengo que generar ?
[2016-05-14 10:58:40 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] nezZario, (you might want to look at ext4 mountpoint options on the frequency of flush)
[2016-05-14 10:58:47 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] me explico ?
[2016-05-14 10:58:50 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] :S
[2016-05-14 10:59:01 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] yo lo haria en 2 partes
[2016-05-14 10:59:08 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] (es que no se si nos entendemos, no por ti, sino pk me explico mal)
[2016-05-14 10:59:12 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] 1) averigo la cantidad total
[2016-05-14 10:59:26 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] 2) hago selects por pagina
[2016-05-14 10:59:32 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] select max(id) from tabla
[2016-05-14 10:59:39 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] y luego, ir paginando
[2016-05-14 10:59:39 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] oks
[2016-05-14 10:59:42 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] y dale con el max
[2016-05-14 10:59:58 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] select count(id) from tabla
[2016-05-14 11:00:03 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] select count(*) from tabla
[2016-05-14 11:00:11 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-14 11:00:20 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] hay varias firmas de hacerlo
[2016-05-14 11:00:28 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] si estas programando un reporte por ejemplo
[2016-05-14 11:00:39 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] yo tiraria 2 selects y paginaria por programa

[2016-05-14 11:00:55 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] voy a ver si me sale  :)
[2016-05-14 11:01:13 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] en general es una buena practica mandar muy pocos selects a la base de datos pidiendole la mayor cantidad posible de datos de una vez
[2016-05-14 11:01:23 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] hello. I wrote a gtk c programm. is there a signal that is send when gtk gui is full shown. So I could starting my programm by this signal.?
[2016-05-14 11:01:24 -0500] [nezZario in #debian] Hmm yeah a ups might be in order.   They're cheap enough
[2016-05-14 11:01:24 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] datos utiles logico no!!

[2016-05-14 11:10:15 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] dreamon: that is fine, I'm just trying to clarify what you want to achieve. I may not be able to help, but maybe I could point you in the right direction.
[2016-05-14 11:10:24 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] Is there a signal send wenn all is ready drawn.
[2016-05-14 11:10:40 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] si imitamos a los argentinos: qu haces forro  que onda!! aca las mujeres como siempre pa chuparce los dedos, fierita!!
[2016-05-14 11:10:47 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] dreamon: I don't know gtk well enough to know how to tell when gtk has fully drawn/loaded the window.
[2016-05-14 11:10:54 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] somiaj, I thankfull for every help
[2016-05-14 11:11:14 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] ja k133___ el chileno te salio re bien
[2016-05-14 11:11:16 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] ajoajoa te recabio por gato alta imitacion
[2016-05-14 11:11:19 -0500] [hmir in #debian] Guys, are there any debian specific SSD settings I need to do i.e. TRIM, or are these all handled automatically by the kernel?
[2016-05-14 11:11:33 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] si xD
[2016-05-14 11:11:45 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] dreamon: any reason you want to do this, i.e. why do you want the program to trigger somethign when it is done?
[2016-05-14 11:11:49 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] de que zona sos k133___
[2016-05-14 11:11:51 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] es que lo chilenos dicen po wn en cada palabra
[2016-05-14 11:12:13 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] hmir: some are, but I think things like TRIM may need have the option incldued in /etc/fstab for the filesystems being used
[2016-05-14 11:12:30 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] hmir: note that for the most part ssd's are a lot better than they originally were and may use them just fine without any extra settings.
[2016-05-14 11:12:39 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] calisto1, de castilla y leon :B
[2016-05-14 11:13:41 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] I wanted to start my code at start my code automaticly.. after windows is ready.. till now I used a timer → g_timeout_add(200,(GSourceFunc)timer_call,callobj);
[2016-05-14 11:14:14 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] But on rasberrypi timer is started before window is ready drawn..
[2016-05-14 11:14:25 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] calisto1, que sea anda por debian, ultimamente estoy mas por la wea fome del windows >.<
[2016-05-14 11:14:31 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] hmir: the only thing I have added to my ssd options are noatime and discard, but I also got this ssd fairly early.
[2016-05-14 11:15:09 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] yo hace 15 años que no uso windows
[2016-05-14 11:15:25 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] hmir: from my understanding is many ssd's should not have much of an effect without this. Some of the older (poorer quality ones) may get some help from this, and some don't even support it. It might be worth researching the actual ssd device/firmware to see what would be approraite.
[2016-05-14 11:15:33 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] tengo alguno por ahi, pero apagado el 99,9999% del tiempo

[2016-05-14 11:16:25 -0500] [hmir in #debian] thanks, somiaj, Johntitor.
[2016-05-14 11:16:47 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] dreamon: have you tried a gtk programing channel? This seems to be something that I think they would have a standard solution for. I just don't know the code at all so can't be much help.
[2016-05-14 11:16:48 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] hmir: you can create the unit and the timer they work as intended, the timer defaults to 1 time every week

[2016-05-14 11:17:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] hmir: https://wiki.debian.org/SSDOptimization note you need to configure LVM and dm-crypt for trim/discard, and that it might not be necessary if you leave some space unallocated
[2016-05-14 11:17:44 -0500] [somiaj in #debian] dreamon: sometimes in the smaller channels you just need to be more patient whil you try google.
[2016-05-14 11:18:09 -0500] [dreamon in #debian] ok  Thanks
[2016-05-14 11:18:47 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] y que wea con bash hay nuevas versiones ? hace que no hago script años xD

[2016-05-14 11:24:26 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] Acaban de entregarme los premios "Medalla de usuarios mas activos #debian-es del 13 (11am) al 14(11am)" , parece que el primer lugar se lo llevo zombie_alike, seguido por rengo, calisto1  y GrabielGF, felicidades! https://ptpb.pw/4CEg.png
[2016-05-14 11:25:29 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, assuming the ssd drive is new, unallocated space is automatically used as cell provision
[2016-05-14 11:25:31 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] ni idea, no soy mucho del bash lo uso pero no soy amante de bash develop k133___
[2016-05-14 11:26:08 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] fuaaa: .... si si desensamblas modificas/agregas y lugo recompilas, pero tendrias que ser excelente programador assembler
[2016-05-14 11:26:26 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] capaz que hay algun desensablador de C pero ni idea
[2016-05-14 11:26:29 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, (the drive's internal logistics make use of it)
[2016-05-14 11:26:43 -0500] [fuaaa in #debian-es] ._.
[2016-05-14 11:27:11 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] me suena
[2016-05-14 11:27:20 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] jml2: true, you can also hedge this by leaving some space unused. also some ssds are blacklisted by the kernel from using discard anyways
[2016-05-14 11:27:29 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] PQntuples
[2016-05-14 11:27:51 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, that's what i use with luks
[2016-05-14 11:27:54 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] marcfp, igual devuelve 1 de que se realizo correctamente
[2016-05-14 11:28:10 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, though if the drive is not blacklisted i would try to test to see if trim is still supported..
[2016-05-14 11:28:29 -0500] [hmir in #debian] Guys, what is the best way to migrate my entire xfce theme/appearance/panel settings from my ubuntu to debian system with both running the same version of xfce. I copied the theme from /usr/share/theme and i copied the xfce4 folder from inside $/.config/ but it didn't properly work. Only partially at best.
[2016-05-14 11:28:40 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, note: a "secure erase" would be necessary on a new install, that would then make unallocated space effective for the extra provision
[2016-05-14 11:28:56 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jmcnaught, (that is if the drive was fully used before and was never using trim)
[2016-05-14 11:29:23 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] alguien sabe que es el mensaje que mando deb: a las 12:24:12?
[2016-05-14 11:29:36 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] ( bit risky, but it's worked well moderately whenever i need to use it https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase )

[2016-05-14 11:30:18 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] the way i do it, is to avoid trim altgoether and try to have the ssd use the cell provision as much as possible, been reading many bad things with trim support in linux
[2016-05-14 11:30:24 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] si me refiero al premio abre una imagen re loca

[2016-05-14 11:31:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmir, maybe the paths are different for the config

[2016-05-14 11:31:37 -0500] [hmir in #debian] Sorry.

[2016-05-14 11:31:49 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] y es una medalla al usuario mas activo y palabras utilizadas en el canal las ultimas 24hrs, solo para romper el hielo
[2016-05-14 11:31:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmir, i only see ~/.config , ..
[2016-05-14 11:32:03 -0500] [Johntitor in #debian] hmir: you have a cat? :P
[2016-05-14 11:32:18 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] me encanto deb, como genero uno?
[2016-05-14 11:32:49 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] hmm, el proyecto no es mio, solo los scripts bash y los logs
[2016-05-14 11:33:05 -0500] [hmir_ in #debian] Yes, is there anything else i need to copy besides ~/.config/xfce4/ to copy over my xfce desktop panel settings????
[2016-05-14 11:33:14 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] se lo paso pro privado
[2016-05-14 11:34:09 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] hmir_: I'm not using Xfce, but there may be things in ~/.local as well
[2016-05-14 11:35:27 -0500] [calisto1 in #debian-es] de donde sos deb?
[2016-05-14 11:35:47 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] mx
[2016-05-14 11:35:49 -0500] [hmir_ in #debian] Okay, thanks. Will check.
[2016-05-14 11:35:59 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] hmir_: Oh, and ~/.cache, though those usually aren't of high importance. Configuration goes in ~/.config, essential data goes in ~/.local/share and non-essential data goes in ~/.cache
[2016-05-14 11:36:27 -0500] [hmir_ in #debian] For sources.list file, it just lists main. I can add "contriib" and "non-free" to the line?
[2016-05-14 11:37:17 -0500] [hexnewbie in #debian] hmir_: You can, if you have non-free programs to install, that is :)
[2016-05-14 11:38:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmir, y
[2016-05-14 11:39:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmir, you can also clone that line and replace jessie with jessie-backports to also have backports
[2016-05-14 11:39:24 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] hmir, (btw it's "contrib", not contriib)
[2016-05-14 11:44:12 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] k133___: algo no hago bien
[2016-05-14 11:45:13 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] marcfp, en que lenguaje es ?
[2016-05-14 11:46:55 -0500] [wsky in #debian] do i need a sim card installed to use a thinkpad x220 gps module?
[2016-05-14 11:47:12 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] con c
[2016-05-14 11:47:19 -0500] [wsky in #debian] or can gps itself work without a simcard
[2016-05-14 11:47:33 -0500] [wsky in #debian] because it's bond altogether with the wwan module
[2016-05-14 11:48:04 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] ah con c o.O
[2016-05-14 11:48:04 -0500] [wsky in #debian] i think it is, i'm unsure how to check that, all i know is i have a wwan module installed
[2016-05-14 11:48:07 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] wsky, depends on the module, but the one i have in says that you need any simcard in.
[2016-05-14 11:48:11 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] wsky, even one that's not working
[2016-05-14 11:48:22 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] wsky, you should probably google your wwan model
[2016-05-14 11:48:25 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] check lsusb
[2016-05-14 11:48:30 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] y que usas para conectare a la db ?
[2016-05-14 11:50:07 -0500] [wsky in #debian] toruvinn: ok thanks, thinkwiki says i indeed need a sim card
[2016-05-14 11:50:18 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] you probably have the same card i have ;-)
[2016-05-14 11:50:53 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] wsky, i have an old unused (and "disabled" by the carrier) card around, you can come pick it up any time ;-)PP
[2016-05-14 11:51:06 -0500] [wsky in #debian] :D|
[2016-05-14 11:52:26 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] oh btw, since people here know a lot of weird things, anyone else had CompuTrace in their x220? mine has it (bought it used, company i bought it from was apparently using those). i contacted them, but they stopped responding after some time ("waiting for the company to respond to their inquiry")... anyone ever tried removing this crap?;-)
[2016-05-14 11:52:35 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] google said it wasn't that easy
[2016-05-14 11:54:33 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] actually, i should just email "absolute" again i guess.
[2016-05-14 11:54:46 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] mmm
[2016-05-14 11:55:07 -0500] [marcfp in #debian-es] #include <libpq-fe.h>
[2016-05-14 11:56:37 -0500] [wsky in #debian] toruvinn: i have no bloody idea what computrance is
[2016-05-14 11:56:57 -0500] [wsky in #debian] toruvinn: and i found a sim card of mine that is dedicated for accessing internet
[2016-05-14 11:57:09 -0500] [k133___ in #debian-es] oh ok
[2016-05-14 11:57:11 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] wsky, should be perfect, good luck :-)
[2016-05-14 11:57:16 -0500] [wsky in #debian] wasn't payed for a while but i know the isp provides free access on it for limited time
[2016-05-14 11:57:33 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] to use gps i dont think you even need it to connect to the carrier.
[2016-05-14 11:57:39 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] you just need a card in for whatever reason
[2016-05-14 11:57:52 -0500] [hmir in #debian] What is midori?
[2016-05-14 11:57:59 -0500] [wsky in #debian] a web browser
