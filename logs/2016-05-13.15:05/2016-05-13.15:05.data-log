Mason963: (and the bot were very clear). can't help you markybob: what difference does make? I'm actually Windows does that mean should not join the channel? Mason963: i'll have the bot tell you one more time !ubuntu Ubuntu based Debian but not Debian. Only Debian supported #debian. Use #ubuntu chat.freenode.net instead.

Someone #allegro said opened bug against the package https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=824157 does help send trivial patch well? guess the problem not much the patch why the decision was made) Mason963: yea think the best way you mail that list and decribe with much detail possible and attach the proposed patch mutante: thanks and link the bug too mutante: don't the bug reports get sent the list? Mason963: yea. they apparently. you can read the whole archives http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-games-devel/ yeah was just looking the archive for may and seems bit ... not very active it's mostly automatic messages from other components quick hope) question...booted debian lxde 8.4 live 32bit off usb(unetbootin)on atom n2600 netbookdoes not boot default use the safe mode.but very slow running and looks like only one core being used when its dual core cpu..any ideas? hello. How enable direct (dio) php5? which .deb package needed? Mason963: make some the -buntu people use Debian and volunteer whats negros anybody polish here? Ho2k-bug: that's because unetbootin breaks debian's installer !unetbootin UNetbootin (Universal Netboot Installer) allows creation bootable USB drives for variety Linux distributions. http://unetbootin.sf.net/ Not recommended for use with Debian CD/DVD images mangles the installer cruel and unusual ways resulting hard debug problems.

Ho2k-bug: are you using windows copy the image usb? yes markbob Ho2k-bug: then you need use win32diskimager !win32diskimager win32diskimager much more reliable than <unetbootin> for copying ISO images USB sticks and you can download from http://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/ Adjust the file mask from *.img black-star.jpg crea_grafica-colored.py crea_grafica-colored.py~ crea_grafica-simple.py crea_grafica-simple.py~ fn.png fn-worldcloud-color.png Gemfile.lock hyp-pink.jpg lita_chat.log lita_config.rb README.md stormtrooper_mask.png thinking.png transp-circle.png doesn't show our .iso images.

One old box (Wheezy) one new (Jessie). For some reason TERM seems screwed new Jessie boxes. both Jessie and Wheezy TERM reports xterm. Jessie however this causing several annoying issues including: home end keys not working pasting vim results pasted content being executed outside insert mode (even with :set paste) broken 256color support. All these problems appear completely resolved manually overriding TERM screen(-256color) dkms happily builds the module But the thing is... I'm not using screen. tmux anything the sort o_O cerebro_: did you make xorg.conf file? that was more tl;dr than anticipated xorg.conf referencing the 'nvidia' driver place (generated using 'nvidia-xconfig') modinfo 'nvidia' fails but modinfo 'nvidia-legacy-340xx' may not even related Jessie vs. Wheezy though maybe datacenter did something weird when they set new boxes but have idea what they could have done seems like alias isn't there somehow Kirito: this local shell terminal emulator you're talking about? jmcnaught Yes connecting over SSH (even though I've been told million times that's not all relevant) Mate Terminal VTE works fine Wheezy with seemingly the same setup can't find any obvious differences jmcnaught just for you know I've formatted host with jessie defaults installed just qemu-kvm libvirt-bin firmware-linux-nonfree and firmware-realtek during the installation the guest get kernel panics but the installation seems more stable overall jmcnaught guess time test hardware and exclude that possibility from the list Kirito: usually use gnome-terminal and terminator (in gnome jessie) and haven't noticed any problems. maybe test with brand new user account see it's local per-user config issue? also thanks for your patience hehe Devastator: are you creating the guest domain using virt-manager GUI? you have Debian desktop system you could test with try and reproduce? Devastator: unless it's some choice you're making while creating the VM.. you've tried sticking close defaults possible? jmcnaught yes for the former for the latter but guess can come with something jmcnaught basically default choose "local media install" pick the image file set Linux set Version Debian Wheezy later pick the storage and done jmcnaught libvirtd seems stopping randomly well because sometimes get disconnected from qemu:///system Devastator: that's interesting. the host you could look "journalctl libvirtd" for clues that's why think something might wrong with hardware they are indeed jmcnaught well see few these: May 22:32:26 morpheu libvirtd[682]: End file while reading data: Input/output error that's not good.. Devastator: have some those too actually they might red herrings jmcnaught hum.. Devastator: how much RAM are you giving the guest while installing? jmcnaught host has 4GB I'm setting 1524MB for the guest Devastator: and this host box you have physical access dedicated server some datacentre? jmcnaught it's box have physical access Devastator: the host low memory_ I've installed debian successfully with just 256MB memory the guest RoyK doesn't seem like I've installed only standard system tools ssh server and xorg able run virt-manager the host mean what output 'free'? !pastebin not paste more than lines this channel.

Ask about <pastebinit> <nopaste> <wgetpaste>. RoyK http://codepad.org/kSlQNii8 that's obviously not the problem motherboard chipset P35 (ICH9) could that the problem? although I'm leaving default while creating (i440x) the problem with the guest doubt the mobo the source the issue this point don't know where the problem anymore.. host seems stable Devastator: anything dmesg the host? except from the libvirtd stopping and restarting Devastator: dmesg pastebinit RoyK http://codepad.org/nN4t2Ho0 Devastator: perhaps use dmesg Devastator: but doesn't look like anything there RoyK that's what thought.. wish someone had spare machine he/she could try reproduce problems haven't read the full history could you summarise please? RoyK sure I'm installing Debian 8.4 this computer learn how use KVM I've downloaded latest Debian 8.4 netinst put flash drive and installed the host. First time used the kernel from backports and I'm new and having all kinds problems I've decided start over with Debian 8.4 with its defaults RoyK I've partitioned harddrive this: Created host-vg and put /home and swap there created another for the VMs another LV? reason use two VGs the same disk Devastator: you're using this exact image: http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso and not some other netboot mini.iso? but then that shouldn't matter jmcnaught yes exactly that image Devastator: have you tried booting debian live see works? not for the installation just see runs okay jmcnaught but guess can usually just uses CD1 for installations case networking messed RoyK well that's the summary story and host hardware is: Q6600 4GB (2x2GB) and 500GB HDD Devastator: can't see reason for things failing should work yes for LVM just use single per disk and single for that disk and just use separate LVs top that not directly related your problems though the idea for the separate for libvirt came from that members the libvirt group can't things the LVs for root and swap RoyK was advised use two that when using the storage pool and /home wouldn't seen this image ok? http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-8.4.0-amd64-lxde-desktop.iso Devastator: should use the official one are you using desktop these VMs? RoyK I'm not will application server jmcnaught: kvm guest won't have access the host's LVM setup Devastator: for testing sure. also what point does the installer kernel panic and are you able able show the errors from the guest's console? RoyK: know what mean not being able see the host's LVs the libvirt storage pool jmcnaught the installer panics while installing the packages after tasksel jmcnaught: that doesn't matter much really Devastator: just install the guest with ssh and basic stuff only install the rest later RoyK that's what I'm trying only select ssh server and standard system utilities Devastator: was having strange crashes laptop until installed the intel microcode package from non-free aptitude shows GPG error for APT.spideroak.com. this related SHA1 per debian wiki? Looks like they were contacted just ignore this until "they" fix there something should manually? RoyK: doesn't really matter just like keep things logically separated jmcnaught: that shouldn't needed robysath: you're using testing yes. and this isn't testing support. /topic jmcnaught: logically separated from another jmcnaught need reboot after installing intel-microcode? jmcnaught: personally like things separated bit more like physical disks for the root and zpool mdraid for the data VMs markybob: i'm not using testing i'm using jessie !testing Testing continuously updated release between <stable> and <unstable> currently codenamed <stretch>.

Devastator: you could also try looking "journalctl -xn 50" see the most recent entries after the problem happens see there's errors the host something RoyK unfortunately Devastator: old hardware isn't necessarily bad really thought this hardware would capable running VMs decent way (unless you drag your old i486 with its 8MBs RAM into here) Devastator: does have hardware virtualisation support? RoyK yup intel amd? Intel Core2Quad Q6600 vmx listed under flags /proc/cpuinfo? RoyK http://codepad.org/FZylauwD markybob alls good. Hello everyone Ho2K-Bug: yay Devastator: again you try install that guest where does fail? random certain point? know smart errors can stupid and not real...but the input/output errors posted...i don't know. RoyK usually while installing the packages after tasksel Would anyone kind enough help with little problem? Devastator: usually? RoyK yes jaymaker long not windows then suppose maybe. jaymaker but about debian Devastator: wrote this little thing just stress the memory runnning system https://www.karlsbakk.net/memstress/ RoyK jmcnaught live image gave kernel panic about not being able mount root Ugh! Hence why I'm the debian channel jaymaker: you'd surprised Anyways can't seem update. I'll try update and get this error Error while installing package: trying overwrite '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp8-platform.so.2.0.1' which also package libp8-platform2v4 Devastator: you may want try see can panic you machine !tell jaymaker about bat Devastator: you may want power down the system and run memtest86 bat? jaymaker: read what the bot said and provide that info RoyK yes that's what thought.. bitflip memory can rather bad OH! Sorry everything about yells hardware good bat good hardware when some rightwing people come close RoyK: um...i think you got mixed up. the hardware wasn't about bat. Devastator markybob: didn't mix things was making wee joke oh. too late for that here sorry someone might have take over for anyway. pretty tired. just fyi jaymaker thanks anyways marky same markybob: Devastator: did you try memtest? damn hadn't quit him yet...and there are ton people here RoyK will have try tomorrow because the computer work.. I'm accessing from work computer via teamviewer hehe Devastator: try that memstress thing just set vm.panic and vm.panic_on_oops first see sysctl erm kernel.panic and kernel.panic_on_oops not vm. just case the thing crashes it'll reboot and hopefully come again should I've seen that program break systems with bad memory few times RoyK gcc memstress.c? download the files from https://www.karlsbakk.net/memstress/ and run "make" right you only need the file and the makefile haven't touched the code for years but should work RoyK how set kernel.panic and kernel.panic_on_oops? export? Devastator: /etc/sysctl.d/01-mystuff.conf add kernel.panic and kernel.panic_on_oops separate lines run sysctl /etc/sysctl.d/01-mystuff.conf you can manually too just echo /proc/sys/kernel/panic etc but that won't last over reboot your program running got the panic setting? yup hopefully something will happen seems something bad with your hardware RoyK http://codepad.org/ViT0mPP5 time wait hehe use few more passes iirc there's something there use indefinete passes don't remember printf(" <passes> set for infinite test\n"); yes have intermitent problems with front audio panel... any tips diagnosing it? RoyK started again with but first time passed well I'll off soon too 00:12 here that program should need little rewrite Devastator: where that? brazil nite hora dormir mesmo então. RoyK thanks! nite! well thats happened re-installed debian lastnight and using more ram then was old install How does that work ._. and has less processes than the old one wait might not hypermist what you mean "using more ram"? hypermist either you installed different debian (jessie wheezy) went 64bit instead you're counting disk cache... you can have different kernel different buffers set literally whatever. ;-P used jessie 64bit and says rsys using 182mb Hello there! have just installed Debian for the first time and having lot problems. have managed figure them out with the exception whenever try use apt-get aptitude dpkg install any packages get the error message "cannot execute binary file". search results don't seem relevant issue. Can anyone oint the right direction? brownchickenbrow: which iso did you use? uhhm Debian's site downloaded the DVD rom the AMD64 version and then dded flash drive does that answer your question? brownchickenbrow: how can figure that out? brownchickenbrow: assume you look wherever you downloaded brownchickenbrow: have broken iso's why ask brownchickenbrow: are you trying install 32bit binaries? are you wanting the filename? it's brownchickenbrow: want the filename and full url you have brownchickenbrow: and your machine 64bit? yes The site https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/ and the DVD the AMD64 version. brownchickenbrow: no. doesn't answer the question. brownchickenbrow: that site has links broken iso's brownchickenbrow they're asking you installed anything outside debian repositories not all what i'm asking and the iso debian-8.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso unable install anything. fresh install. brownchickenbrow: and your exact command copy over was? don't remember. brownchickenbrow: sha256sum that? brownchickenbrow the error for non setup apt not binary execution failure unless you don't have root privilege RoyK I'm sorry? brownchickenbrow: you follow the install guide you'd debian-8.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso /dev/sdX (not /dev/sdX1 block device not partition) brownchickenbrow: plus you sha256sum make sure the download wasn't corrupted brownchickenbrow: check the checksum the iso before you use brownchickenbrow: *always* that really Okay. the future will look how that. brownchickenbrow: doesn't matter what distro just check correct think said installed debian yeah I'm using talk you guys right now don't really cared installed unicorn. can't answer basic questions can't answer brownchickenbrow that error mentioned previously brownchickenbrow apt default does not have its sources.list fully setup needs answer those basic things before can help creates new super-debian iso redistribute brownchickenbrow with lot super-extra software brownchickenbrow (by default only cdrom source would set) jml2: that wouldn't give that error markybob ask for pastebin markybob maybe he's not quoting properly basics first I'm really sorry guys really trying here. don't understand what you are asking there's point move you don't know where you're starting from markybob: such supheric acid? markybob that's why you ask for pastebin RoyK: now that one got wait that's not basic jml2: pastebin won't answer the questions i've asked markybob would. markybob you ask for checksum pastebin. jml2: okay. you can have this one. enjoy markybob you don't seem efficient lol tells markybob take break! the whole point asking basics efficient and not waste time. what you're talking about nonsense sources.list doesn't cause that error because dvd markybob the point even mentions has debian installed and using atm for irc? markybob that's little too far-fetched imho have fun then brownchickenbrow you know what checksum is? and its purpose? I'm really sorry caused this happen. have been using ubuntu for about months and thought that was ready try Debian. really confused and don't know what doing make things difficult. I'm really sorry don't understand. Yes. don't know how check one brownchickenbrow md5sum file.iso jml2 yes brownchickenbrow there's winmd5sum for windows brownchickenbrow the md5sums will the same directory you downloaded the iso ...is that command? brownchickenbrow brownchickenbrow "md5" brownchickenbrow think its md5 osx.. dunno what you used the downloading platform.. brownchickenbrow and there's sha256sum which you can check against the sh256sums file from the download directory brownchickenbrow it's the same thing.. but using different algorithm checksum uhh was using ubuntu brownchickenbrow you only need verify just checksum algo should open terminal other computer where originally downloaded Debian and type "md5sum <filename>" the filename being the Debian iso? brownchickenbrow Thank you will that now brownchickenbrow then you compare that output with http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/MD5SUMS brownchickenbrow the dvd which elsewhere brownchickenbrow http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-dvd/MD5SUMS The numbers are the same. That means the file complete yes? brownchickenbrow brownchickenbrow you have setup your apt.. brownchickenbrow did you use sudo "root" with apt-get brownchickenbrow here's what brownchickenbrow just lazily this the start then fine tune later used "su <username>" because seems don't have sudo installed brownchickenbrow /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/ lazy sounds good. I'm beginner. brownchickenbrow apt-get update apt-get install netselect-apt brownchickenbrow after fine-tune the problem that can't install anything update get that error brownchickenbrow try logging root brownchickenbrow (not sudo) uhm like virtual terminal? brownchickenbrow terminal brownchickenbrow can xterm well because not presented with the option the GUI when boot brownchickenbrow (xterm=gui terminal) can xterm? what command used? brownchickenbrow "su brownchickenbrow then type root's passwd root? brownchickenbrow you can use "su -l" think that might better I'm too late should try again with that argument? brownchickenbrow you can you want brownchickenbrow ctl-d logs out what does do? brownchickenbrow type logout that brownchickenbrow for switiching root account brownchickenbrow small mean the argument what does do? brownchickenbrow already told brownchickenbrow you need help "-l" you can use "man su" brownchickenbrow and type "q" exit the manpage viewer brownchickenbrow: what does do? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksCTVFtjM4 brownchickenbrow that gives details the options brownchickenbrow can sometimes help ensure the environment set properly for the login user brownchickenbrow /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/ I'm sorry I'm waay behind you can't log out brownchickenbrow apt-get update apt-get install netselect-apt brownchickenbrow then debian not for you brownchickenbrow doing checksum much more harder.. you can that you should able this well brownchickenbrow are you trolling? Okay was trying patient and polite because you were trying help but you are being complete jerk !ops brownchickenbrow trolling Hydroxide dondelelcaro LoRez RichiH mentor abrotman Maulkin stew peterS Myon Ganneff weasel zobel themill babilen SynrG jm_ somiaj jelly: jml2 complains about: brownchickenbrow trolling you are not explaining yourself clearly not idiot ignores brownchickenbrow brownchickenbrow: hey why don't you start again with putting the command you used and the full output http://paste.debian.net/ jmcnaught Thank you very much will try that now there lot breakage with sid over time compared rolling distros like Arch and Gentoo? jmcnaught I'm really sorry have never used pastebin before. keep getting errors because the name and now says need two linebreaks because spammers? brownchickenbrow: how long the paste you are trying make? two lines. Could post here maybe? or; how add line break? like html tag? sure two lines fine the channel more than that use the paste site finally got work what give you the url? yup Thank you much for your patience I'm really sorry I'm making much trouble http://paste.debian.net/683675/ brownchickenbrow: you're typing "su cwons apt-get update" cwons looks like your username. also seems that you are already root. can you please try just "apt-get update" without the "su cwons" the start? wow! that worked! was not root when tried that earlier should just log into root whenever want install something? brownchickenbrow: only root can install stuff. you can become root with "su -l" (and then enter root password). When you are root the last character your prompt changes from brownchickenbrow: you can also install sudo you're more familiar with that. "apt-get install sudo" and then "adduser cwons sudo" put your user the sudo group was tying <user> before but did not use the -i. checked the man page and not see argument listed anywhere. This when that other guy thought was trolling brownchickenbrow: since you're new and all there's lot great material here especially the handbook and reference: https://www.debian.org/doc/ thank you! very thorough with documentation will definitely through this brownchickenbrow: that's "su -l" small short for login. The reason you don't put username the command because you want become root which the default "su the same "su -l" That makes sense! tried installing sudo and asked insert the disc that contains it... brownchickenbrow: well you can that you can edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file remove the CD-ROM lines. recommend making look like the example this page: https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList all other sources are commented out. Could that because installed debian offline? does anyone here use the newsbeuter rss feed loader know thing about brownchickenbrow: yes. once you make look like the example the page linked you'll able install software from network mirrors que mamadas http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e76_1463110601 Title: LiveLeak.com Man enters with fuel put into horse and assails trader. (at www.liveleak.com) Hello. lady irc? Perposterous jmcnaught Sorry had much difficulty understanding that page. have managed follow the directions and have successfully installed sudo thanks you!!! Not really. jmcnaught Thank you much!! hate people yet I'm IRC figure that one out maybe it's just being pathetic and lonely guess the two hand hand know what mean? Also naturally protruding mammaris helps every once while. s/mammaris/marraries/; penis way too small for that apparently I'm hell easy Curb with the lady long you take time the beginning size might not matter. it's that dang "might" brownchickenbrow: you're welcome. stuff will get easier understand with practice and after you read the fundamentals jmcnaught very excited through the documentation love learning about this stuff The more you worry about the worse will for you. you don't worry and concentrate more other skills will not matter. brownchickenbrow: most the documentation that debian.org/doc page also available packages... debian-handbook and debian-reference for example you know how difficult keeping this subject "family friendly" is? handbook? you man like the man pages? more about skill than equipment. small thing can sometimes very potent. brownchickenbrow: man pages are different mean https://debian-handbook.info/ tortib are you misanthrope? fapfapfap ... lol kidding thank you! deb: what made you think that any that last statement was good idea? haha was smoking cigarette and sorry about not keeping this family friendly don't have the topic showing Lady_Aleena you sound educated using many large words Lady_Aleena now but wasn't always that way. Society slowly turned this way. maybe was like that all along there #debian-vice channel for non-family-friendly discussion? tortib read lot and exposed large words times which get inserted normal vocabulary. Some words are express much little space. Good morning Lady_Aleena look them know what the heck someone trying say instead just saying what they really want say. Yall gotta used some big word tortib big words are just cooler use than bunch small ones. would argue that the degree which one's speech sounds "sophisticated" has lot more with grammar than with vocabulary. yeah but you're trying communicate with normal joe schmo it's tough s/grammar/grammar and phrasing/ yeah would suck the language got reduced only few thousand small words. doubleplusungood. tortib like expanding people's worlds through vocabulary. O.o Lady_Aleena jmcnaught: there's that xkcd book explaining scientific concepts using the 1000 most common English words I'm IRC too much because the other day instinctively tried regex-replace something said out loud jmcnaught: https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/ Some people don't like people who use big words pharpend: there's also simple english version wikipedia but still respect diction tortib also I've forgotten how express some ideas smaller forms for example know what rhetorical question but don't make define rhetorical. there's growing subset English experts who argue that simplicity speech virtuous because allows you convey wider audience It's asking question that either has answer the person asking doesn't expect answer how difficult that explain? view English writing changed quite bit when started studying linguistics tortib um.... now hate prescriptive rules with passion For instance English there's logical reason not end phrase with preposition don't even remember all the prepositional phrases Italic languages ungrammatical but ending phrases with prepositions fine English Guess makes sense why I'm poor now lol just dumb dude passivization also fine tortib: you were smart enough choose Debian don't think choosing something takes much intelligence but yeah had debian mac pro unless you're ... (whatever Debian's rival distro is) user Ubuntu guess I'm still new Debian would prefer straight debian but don't like Gnome not one bit find difficult use (mostly because don't know the keyboard shortcuts) used Arch and was considered mortal sin ever bring Manjaro Gentoo even dang Manjaro Arch (kind of) what Ubuntu Debian markets itself more user-friendly yeah same antergos love gnome tortib you need more confidence yourself. First member size and now language usage. Lady_Aleena meh don't care dammit all this talk penis size going make vote for Trump. let's stop. I'm confident that have enough confidence able look flaws tortib remember misanthrope. tortib you like kittens? Lady_Aleena wasn't always that way know did actually like people for while even when was treated like crap. But that has quickly changed Lady_Aleena I'm dog person Lady_Aleena but dog thinks its cat that counts likes kittens but really doesn't like puppies they are very messy cats are clean that's what like about cats have stray bunch hair which keeps falling down into face which annoying bit. pharpend have kitten napping lap the moment. cat screaming from the other room pharpend what does your cat want? don't know she's just awful. date and time correct but keep getting emails and says it's 7:00AM instead 10:00PM i'm using thunderbird pharpend well you might well find out what she wants she will unbearable. Lady_Aleena: noise cancelling headphones are solution then you just teach the cat that gets its way it's annoying jmcnaught: mhm jmcnaught cats always get their way. slave her kitten. I'm slave one don't even have job Lady_Aleena I'm total boyfriend material rite? lol i'm screwed isn't even funny .coffee avis brews tasty tiny cup coffee and gives avis .cookie tortib gives tortib bacon cookie don't think bacon should anywhere near cookie rotfl. wow why did say don't damn dumb bet bacon cookies pair well with pork sode legion plotting something s/sode/soda I'm sure will bad whatever really should get and take meds (diabetic). brb they will more than likely degrade windows computer don't know how what they will Legion just wants bring the heretic geths back into the broader geth family Buenas ... jmcnaught who are these geths Hello. using stable. have some issues with few apps. Should consider moving testing? stable the testing word just there because lack any other suitable word? apparently from video game? tortib: yeah they're like the Cylons the Mass Effect trilogy Rust3dCor3: you could very well end having more problems testing since it's not finished yet.

Whats the status bugg #689992 Bug http://bugs.debian.org/689992 bootlogd (open): «bootlogd doesn't log anything /var/log/boot»; severity: important; opened: 2012-10-08; last modified: 2013-09-29. Hi. Are there any other ways restore permissions `/usr/bin` their default? https://matoski.com/article/debian-restore-var-ownership-permissions/ !gm buenos dias todos parte teraflops Hi. Why does the following command remove the setuid-bit from `/usr/bin/sudo`? sudo find /usr/bin/ -user douglas -exec chown root '{}' how can figure out what the device file for microphone? shingouz: dmesg Maybe. What kind microphone it? `sudo journalctl -a` might also help. nothing showing there any consequence. just something plugged into the sound card input dutchfish giving partay? looks like either have reboot and reread dmesg remove/insert the sound modules. the uptime this one too high for any relevant information sit any acessible place. well... off modprobing then debian not recognize the .ovpn file have installed network-manager-openvpn-gnome shingouz: You have look into ALSA and PulseAudio. shingouz: USB you won’t see under `/dev`. shingouz: There alsa-info.sh script from the ALSA project which might give you valuable information. CutMeOwnThroat: did you hear? Pool party dutchies place! ahh... thanks PaulePanter. looks like this takes little more work than prepared this exact moment have hack later today. there are other more important things laundry for instance shingouz: problem. know the feeling. can install debian without also installing Quatroking: sure does anyone happen know how move this stupid thing? http://imgur.com/qdCqms7 this option during setup something? just upgraded kali and hate the desktop the normal installer ask you what "group" package you want neat you can avoid choosing there plan re-using old thinclient basic MAME machine just small project trying out the setup vmware first Quatroking: just avoid installing the "desktop environment" set packages and you should fine Alright will this still allow run GUI applications somehow? mean can run gparted through x11 forwarding over SSH does this work local too? you need have x11 server least and most probably window manager too see harmonious: Look for extension for GNOME doing that. default it’s not possible knowledge. but you said you can use x11 forwarding you need gui app but don't want harmonious: But guess there are enough answers the Internet. Johann right because have X11 running SSH client Yeah that makes sense Quatroking: still you try minimize your install you should try administrate your server without gui app yeah can pretty much everything through SSH without problem it's just that stuff like gparted just easy also just-in-case scenario fdisk too when you get used what the latest debian linux kernel? hrm. have styles broken for anyone else? for all but Adwaita and High Contrast are borked. lose slider controls (or they're invisible) kernels Available kernel versions are: experimental: 4.6.0-rc7-686-pae (4.6~rc7-1~exp1); sid: 4.5.0-2-686-pae (4.5.3-2); stretch: 4.5.0-2-686-pae (4.5.3-2); jessie-backports: 4.5.0-0.bpo.1-686 (4.5.1-1~bpo8+1); jessie: 3.16.0-4-686-pae (3.16.7-ckt25-1); wheezy-backports: 3.16.0-0.bpo.4-686-pae (3.16.7-ckt25-2~bpo70+1); wheezy: 3.2.0-4-686-pae (3.2.78-1) using sarge. sexytime: see zykotick9 don't suppose debian can installed over ssh something that won't need monitor and extra keyboard for installation? can't access nfs partition "/media/dn3_" and when I'm trying unmount says "umount.nfs: /media/dn3_: Stale NFS file handle" how fix mean sure have spare monitor but could just main desktop that'd great JustinHitla: umount should fix it.... stale server generated... hasn't historically had much luck "umount -f"ing stale NFS mounts... there way completely disable ipv6 for everything (even docker) there way completely disable ipv6 for everything (even docker) dka: why? dka via grub dka: disabling ipv6 for everything looks like !xy also not recommended all ChrisH: "-f" not working either what exactly this 'pristine-tar' tool? I've not found good explanation far does wicd-curses save changes the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file? lss9: two people take the same set files and tar them their own systems they generally won't get identical .tar files why? different versions tar produce slightly different files even with the same version there might things like user ids different archive creation timestamp something don't know much about the tar format) pristine-tar lets the second person generate the same .tar file the first person giving them small delta file that contains all the bits the tar archive other than the files themselves why would someone use pristine-tar also you can always diff "tar -l" output both archives and find out the differences buenas muyayos :-) makes easier for people get the exact original tarball for specific release software project without needing keep giant archive all tarballs ever released for the project sitting around (the delta file small enough into source control) its strange have stallen NFS link /media/dn3_ and can't into but can open files inside that directory using links files "cd /media/dn3_" says "bash: cd: /media/dn3_: Stale NFS file handle" but "cd /media/dn3_/_3/_9" changes that directory why that and "/media/dn3_/_3" and "cd .." can't says "bash: cd: ..: Stale NFS file handle" created first project and want package for debian. didn't find good tutorial for beginners how so. any recommendations? the "official" docs are really hard understand the new maintainer's guide? yup hello need help looking for help any one ??? How reload /etc/aliases after editing?

It's topic long he's trying boot Debian stable but may not know. #debian-boot OFTC may have smarter people this topic default fedora "forces" the user install lvm i'm using debian just use fpaste cause like sh00p you're liar. sh00p #fedora certainly NOT liar sh00p you download debian you would downloaded 8.4 plz stop trolling jml2 debootstrapping debian for embedded system sh00p shoot. now embedded system. right.

NoCode don't think there are any unfortunately !handbook The Debian Administrator's Handbook http://debian-handbook.info/ and can browsed bought and downloaded. From Debian "Wheezy" onwards can also can installed from the debian-handbook package. Also ask about <books> <docs>. NoCode there's the debian-handbook.info NoCode but imho tries cut too much corners NoCode there's also the debian wiki which also helpful NoCode you're interested other sources outside debian can share them sorry one more question the string need change foo for bar foo@email.com hqve sed -i.bak s/^foo$/bar/g narrow the question down bit. you're interested specific subject may able give more targeted answers. afernandez_: ^foo$ will only match whole lines where the entire line "foo" nothing else. Well have debian server installed. I'm just looking for nice tutorial/ nice way get postfix running securely and with antispam VPS doesn't complain get banned from their services greycat just want replace foo for bar leave the rest the line untouched Then don't use the anchors and Thanks need execute bash script when starting daemon with /etc/init.d/openvpn start will suffice just add the path the script right after the "start-stop-daemon" line the init script? dn: what version Debian? buenas greycat: for those interested turns out didn't have lvm2 installed thanks anyways Then there ought systemd service you can edit instead legacy init.d script. i'm for holding hands and dancing greycat: alright could that the reason doesn't work? need dedicated server and need web server have choose for it? can install Debian (32/64) Debian LAMP Ubuntu workstation Ubuntu server CentOS which one would you choose? https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/openvpn/filelist yes there systemd unit file You should probably create /etc/systemd/system/openvpn.service with lines override the parts /lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service that you want override. glares Google-Chrome hi. how get library packaged and pushed into debian stable repo? Where you dance? it's very small lightweight lib https://github.com/mreiferson/libevbuffsock New packages are not going added stable. That's what stable means. how they eventually get stable? What process room when noone watching. that's not the streets You have been assimilated They're uploaded unstable then they migrate into testing they meet certain criteria and then into future stable release they meet even more criteria. need package and submit unstable? greycat: create file /etc/ststemd/system/ will run when starting the service? will act local overrides for the corresponding lines the /lib version the file. and doesn't matter that /lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service only systemd target? doesn't need init script? where does the log for isc-dhcpd wheezy? guys.

I’m having trouble getting Apache autostart vagrant Debian Wheezy OS. starts after boot just fine. I’ve ran this command: sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults But that just returns: update-rc.d: using dependency based boot sequencing and this all because you wanted learn how act like baby Would removing and adding help? Been trying install old game (UT2004) without any luck... Could anyone try help confirm that impossible? did? jaja tipo -es aconsejando otro que use gentoo just Unreal Tournament general luck installing esos son los amigos verdad does anyone have any information how interface with the SystemUpdates from systemd for offline system updates using jessie? https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/ BinBasher: know codeweavers supports more less trying determine way implementing but haven't found any specifics and how jessie will work with yet. 'fraid akiTendo should give output what did akiTendo apache enabled you'll see entry /etc/rc2.d/ is. figured out what was going wrong it’s vagrant. akiTendo apache running? akiTendo (netstat -plunt) the maching /var/www nfs mount. Debian tries start apache before vagrant completes that mount crashing start. The solution have vagrant call for restart the tail its startup script. little sloppy but it’s sandbox vm. akiTendo btw there's #vagrant that channel too. was unclear whether was Debian issue vagrant issue when first hit the error. And why aren’t fingers finding the right letter keys this morning?? akiTendo believe it's vagrant issue but have solution. akiTendo apache true debian system always works i've been using apache for years actually debian akiTendo surprises because even then "http://localhost" would working Read comment above the problem was attempt start the server before the drive containing all the websites mounted. The work around just let fail then have vagrant call for start after mounting the drive. the machine internally reboots should fine virtualbox should maintain the nfs mount that unlikely event. jml2: what the hell does "apache true debian system always works" mean? teraflops: think he’s referencing the fact I’m running not bare metal. teraflops said was #vagrant... was already saying was vagrant issue teraflops dunno how much modifications were made his debian template machine (it's virtual machine) (if even bothered read what and why) jml2: Heh heh. Well thanks. It’s true vm’s have their idiosyncracies. Better than the headache that MAMP though. I’m trying get company off that monstrosity onto something where the server deployments including the sandboxes can completely automated through ansible. some providers completely rip things out their templates.. know for fact ovh doesn't... True. Still I’m hoping will least slightly more accurate for developing webscripts. the very least will case sensitive (OSX and therefor MAMP not) but the issue related nfs read properly dunno you'll have find out teraflops: sorta. The issue things have happen certain order the webserver needs happen after the NFS mount completes. jml2: Ya. Well got PHP compile and run using almost the same ./configure Media Temple used I’m hoping that will sufficient stop surprises (almost left out the disable-debug flag) hello guys today's days what determines the name the interfaces when are installing linux? "/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent...? jair: debian yes. probably different when comes out jair last read there was new convention for all linux.. dunno debian will adopting that it's what fedora already using think did fresh install thinkpad carbon 2016 and noticed that the interfaces are named something very weird jair: fresh install what? which debian release? jair like enc**** jair yeah that would fine jair it's the new standard for all linux ... jair would start with jair i've never seen debian "yet" jair (lwn.net) using "unstable" sid jair can see ifconfig jair (pastebin) hold booting the machine jair: well that's why. it's fine have boolean variable .bashrc how can switch its state for perminently. tried using export but that only was temporary RippyDippy ~/.profile http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles jair@x1:~$ cat /etc/debian_version stretch/sid jml2: http://paste.debian.net/683750/ jair interesting jelly: http://paste.debian.net/683750/ jair thanks ... they are really implementing and keeping this jair: that actual debian installation derivative? really weird name jair: what does "lsb_release -sc" say jml2: mean command flip the boolean back and forth .bashrc how would profile help that? jair had bookmark that year article you might able find the explanation why linux adopting this RippyDippy you mean like shopt jelly: derivative jml2: mean like... export but actually globally changing the variable jair: does really matter? you'll get used it. https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ RippyDippy: you cannot change every instance enviroment variable every running process. RippyDippy you mean for all users? Not even for yourself. jair: you want ask the support venue for that derivative then RippyDippy you might look /etc/environment /etc/profile Change the variable assignment your dot files then log out and back in. Already-running processes will retain their variables. teraflops: that not problem actually the point can modify and add the name want like eth0 eth1 lan1 lan2 etc... jair: why? anyway read the link pasted above greycat: wonder why bash zsh enthusiast hasn't whipped async way update env.vars perhaps with pre-prompt fucntion greycat: would like flip and then refresh bashrc loging and out would defeat the purpose it'd just for interactive shells but that may good enough RippyDippy: ONE SHELL? That you can do. Edit the .bashrc and then exec bash. THAT ONE SHELL will updated. RippyDippy: but your other shells will not. teraflops: thanks for the article Nor will your window manager you are inheriting from window manager etc. jair: Hopefully this tutorial works well: http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-mail-server-setup-with-postfix-dovecot-sasl-squirrel-mail.html just enable IMAP though won't enable POP that process. jair sometimes when "eth0" "eth1" can edit something /etc/udev/rules.d/ ... but don't know about the new convention with interfaces may work not NoCode: might work but you'd stupid for using squirrelmail !tutorials very common problem that some people prefer follow step-by-step tutorial that shows them how setup their system without reading the documentation understanding what they are doing. something goes wrong they have clue whatsoever about where look for hints and they sometimes decide start from scratch using different tutorial. This not The Proper Way. markybob: squirrelmail fugly but probably better security-wise than the popular thing jelly: how you figure? last release 2011 NoCode: that tutorial outdated hell Hello. Does anyone know how load third party firmware from the installer? When asks whether load some from removable media choose "Yes" while flash drive containing plugged hit enter takes minute then just goes back asking again. jelly: date php support... jelly: it's deserted like this? https://i.imgur.com/7ZsXljO.webm pflanze there's the non-free installer which includes the firmware you might need this not going work guess jml2: yes will interesting find out pflanze think you need use the expert mode the installer use side- RippyDippy: what are you actually trying do? hello there pflanze ./side-storage jair you've mentioned that you're using debian derivative.. jair hmm markybob: 1.4-stable svn branch days old Actually I'm getting totally mad with the Debian installer program jml2: worries man that article you gave excellent jelly: did say release. releases are important. That's impossible finish properly basic instalation with LUKS and LVM UEFI hardware. greycat: have silly statement bash that prints out bunch rediculous WatchDogs themed stuff. withing statement meaning $watchDogs true all this silly stuff. jair dont think gave any greycat: But dont want all times just when flip the switch Impossible install grub maybe somebody have idea why RippyDippy: what you mean function? alias? script? jair mentioned lwn.net but didnt look too far I've only ever had learn how configure server with tutorials. Some things have failed but some other things have been learned already. lot people learn differently than others. I'm rather person who learns example and can often get things working after being shown(by tutorial). wouldn't have survived Linux years ago. But today can. What are you doing the variable and where/how are you doing it? jair all recall reading about new convention with linux interfaces.. though dont know how distros will handle either they'll embrace try keep eth0eth1... teraflops What's outdated it? markybob: yeah but are CVEs I'm trying very standard installation exotics things only select proposed choices greycat: None. Its just there prinf few things when the terminal opens. jair but the explanations why that done technical.. jelly: well apart some minor changes and lot happy new year commits squirrelmail looks pretty dead RippyDippy: What "it"? Are you typing script? jml2: thank you yes interesting NoCode: all the dovecot stuff RippyDippy: it's script function and uses variable that you want able change more easily just have read value from file instead using env variable. Then you can edit the file and poof. greycat: Its block printf's withing statement that literally sitting exposed bashrc All future invocations the script/function will read the new value from the file instead the stale value from the env. NoCode: you really have grab tutorial and set complex system I'd recommend the ones workaround.org RippyDippy: FUNCTION that you define and run? just code that only executed once when you launch new bash shell? greycat: No. not function. The latter. Code that executed when launch. jair here found https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ Then editing .bashrc all that's required. only runs when you launch bash only need check the variable that time. teraflops Thanks. jelly thanks I'll look. NoCode: but the way they set things overkill you really need single-domain setup with normal accounts m_b: does this computer use one those fancy new NVME SSDs? which installer image did you download and how did you copy USB? more like this? http://i.imgur.com/F2SaFQN.jpg doesn't even have env var since it's not being used child processes. jml2: yes reading WAIT! HAVE IDEA! Are you actually asking *HOW MAKE EASIER EDIT THE VALUE .bashrc*?? jelly Okay. I'll look anyway. thanks NoCode: find tutorials useful for overview what's involved but it's still important read the docs for postfix dovecot etc you can understand how fix them when things wrong greycat: Nailed it. But globally. Perminently. greycat never seen you excited over very simple issue Any change .bashrc *IS* permanent because it's file. This has been the source confusion all along. lol hey guys how are you /kick TomTomTosch stop trying kill with cute overload warsoul you're troublemaker remember you thought you were asking something entirely different (how modify the existing instance env var across multiple processes) but you're actually asking "how edit file" greycat: used export originally. But that just does temporary for the life the term. its kinda useless when opening new one resets fals jmcnaught Makes sense for sure greycat: Yes thats why was confused why this simple task was causing much trouble. editing .bashrc more work than you want use you can still store the value separate file and read that the code .bashrc. Then editing the value easier because it's not embedded inside shell code. jml2 lol why are you saying that You don't have export it. It's not being used child processes. NoCode: yeah careful you dont want put email server out there without setting properly yeah... "child" processes.. bah! Just pick file and have the .bashrc code read the value from the file. warsoul: guess they're joking jejejeje yeah jelly haha greycat: could actually just open up. Just... would cool with one command obviously alias learning RippyDippy: editing .bashrc file with stupid shell alias not wise. jml2 RippyDippy: use separate file that has nothing else it. Question: there any better Debian installer images? greycat: Nothing about this wise Better containing real tools not busybox?

That was good resolve least. pflanze dude pflanze what kind question was that? jmcnaught: yes brand new nvme SSD jml2 fine (except I'm dealing with 64core server that takes about 10' run through the boot process). jml2 but *always* seem running into issues the installer and *always* need some tool that's not available. use netinstall 8.4 image downloaded from official french mirror and put USB with the command Debian doesn't support nvme SSD? not know why wouldn't work which ultimately was fault anyway. But still! pflanze you'll need way make preparation images use virtualbox set online and use snapshots then later clone that vbox hard-disk.. this way you can keep your production systems separate from the internet and never have worry pflanze isolate "/" from data stores.. just want decent system environment when running the installer. pflanze when you updates you just use updated image cloned from vbox m_b: does but seems some people have had problem installing grub. i've seen workaround where after installing Debian you boot into rescue mode and install grub manually founded http://www.poweredbyjeff.com/2015/10/29/Intel-750-SSD-in-Debian-Jessie/ will try thanks for your answers jmcnaught m_b maybe not the default kernel which might too old for the latest nvm for that you can install the latest from backports m_b kernel 4.4 available from backports it's not 4.5 m_b you should still able install the nvm ssd (hopefully)-- post setup you can just add the newer kernel afterwards m_b above kernel 3.15 you'll wanting use jessie has 3.16 not 3.15 didnt say jessie 3.15 (talking reference actual nvm support upstream) your logic jessie would work it's what's supported the kernel !ping zfs everybody. just installed mysecureshell jessie but when try sftp into get "Connection closed" just after the login.

DammitJim you use disk that auto-resizes iftelf your need value it's cool erm3nda you mean create original disk 300G instead 50GB and let grow that size? Resizing Qemu raw images kids game mean disk with limit your choice 300Gb max but it's size will created "on the file" you installa fresh Windows that disk maybe your virtual disk will about 7Gb currently the more shit you installs the more grows He's asking how resize the partition and then the LVM physical volume (or the volume group) and then the inside the VG. And then the file system inside the LV. can't expand partition about limited file sounds like will need just create new partition every time "expand" the hard drive One option that I'm about 80% sure will work add ANOTHER PARTITION which becomes another Physical Volume the LVM system and then append that new into the and then you have more space the VG. took clonezilla machine and restore machine with larger hard drive You people. just don't get it. greycat you are correct about that You have all these big fancy toys and you have idea how anything works. But it's fancy must right. just thought was little messy the end keep adding more space LOL it's provisioning problem I'm trying clean these year old servers There may other ways. don't know shit about VMware. don't know shit about hard drives that magically grow overnight. https://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_disk_manager_examples.html expand the size virtual disk use command like the following: vmware-vdiskmanager 40GB myDisk.vmdk did even read that documentation? wich kind virtual disk did created? maybe can move the partition with gparted from your actual virtual disk new vmdk that you can modify there recommended set JAVA_HOME for all users Debian? editing /etc/profile perhaps?! gparted should started from live otherwise you cant unount the main drive would anyone here kind and help with https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2016/05/msg00011.html?

Just report yourself. heh can know one thing? <johnkeates> install bash-completion <-installed and same x-fak: did you ACTIVATE your .bashrc file and then exec bash? qqz: i'm just user not systems developer. idea what vtbios is. the questio about virtual terminals not guis. x-fak: loaded? johnkeates loaded? x-fak: grep complet ~/.bashrc x-fak try the shell: /etc/bash_completion" use vnc through ssh secured connection everyday vps with xfce4 desktop even tried cinnamon and Unity vtbios: mean kernel module that sets graphics text mode and manipulates the cursor via BIOS calls greycat grep complet .bashrc gives nothing
