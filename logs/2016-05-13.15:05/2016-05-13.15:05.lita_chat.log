[2016-05-12 16:28:03 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i guess he deactivated the anonymous function :>

[2016-05-12 16:57:44 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] And I don't think it is just YouTube, I think my net connection is slow.
[2016-05-12 16:58:51 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I went to the github link from polyzen and Iceweasel was showing it was still loading. (The indicator was still going around and around and around.)
[2016-05-12 16:58:57 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i've never met anyone talking about gluten in real life. the only reason i hate this thing is the internet :D

[2016-05-12 16:59:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Let's get off of hate, I have a cute kitten who is being adorable at the moment.
[2016-05-12 17:00:12 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] THough any moment she could strike with little warning.
[2016-05-12 17:00:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i find it a little odd that it's sometimes easier to find gluten free alternatives than vegan ones. protect the wheat!
[2016-05-12 17:01:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] must be a NA thing.
[2016-05-12 17:02:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I could never be gluten free or vegan. I love hamburgers.
[2016-05-12 17:02:26 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] yeah probably. there's always several diet fads happening at once, gluten free is a common element to a lot of them i think
[2016-05-12 17:02:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i'm not vegan, just vegetarian, but i miss burgers. veggieburgers are good, but not quite the same
[2016-05-12 17:03:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I don't know the difference, but I've never cared to look into it.
[2016-05-12 17:04:09 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i try to keep it to meat once a week. mostly eat at a canteen that has lots of vegetarian options, so that's nice.
[2016-05-12 17:04:30 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] vegans don't eat any animal products (eggs, milk etc). vegetarians don't eat meat, but do eat eggs, milk
[2016-05-12 17:05:03 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I could never be without milk, especially since hubby works in the industry.
[2016-05-12 17:05:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i love cheese and ice cream too much. there are some okay vegan ice creams.. the vegan cheeses are still a work in progress
[2016-05-12 17:06:41 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] when i do get cravings for meat it's alway for the worst kinds like KFC or McDonalds.. effects of marketing i guess

[2016-05-12 17:51:32 -0500] [t4nk274 in #debian] markybob: not the issue... it is on demo mode.. if you read further it accepts x amount of flows

[2016-05-12 17:51:53 -0500] [markybob in #debian] t4nk274: anyway it's totally off topic. ask them.
[2016-05-12 17:51:54 -0500] [t4nk274 in #debian] markybob: as it states "  NOTE: This is a DEMO version limited to 25000 flows export. "
[2016-05-12 17:52:06 -0500] [t4nk274 in #debian] markybob: it is not even exporting a single flow
[2016-05-12 17:53:29 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] t4nk274: Not a debian issue, it's an issue for the support people.  If they don't support the demo mode, they're probably not worth considering.  Many demos require a demo license (sometimes included in the download).
[2016-05-12 17:54:20 -0500] [t4nk274 in #debian] jhutchins: did some research and it seem it is not related to the license... it is related to the geoip library
[2016-05-12 17:54:50 -0500] [t4nk274 in #debian] that's why i am requesting help here... already removed, purged and reinstalled the geoip libraries and still the same issue
[2016-05-12 17:55:12 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] t4nk274: I think I agree with you.  Perhaps there is a database setup step that has been missed?
[2016-05-12 17:55:12 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] devster31: what about systemd and cgroups? Not a manpage, but this is an okay overview of using cgroups with systemd: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ControlGroupInterface/
[2016-05-12 17:56:13 -0500] [jhutchins in #debian] t4nk274: I'm not sure I agree about geoip being the problem, it's pretty solid.

[2016-05-12 19:50:39 -0500] [markybob in #debian] naptastic: sid suppport is in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net per /topic
[2016-05-12 19:51:26 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] how do I submit a patch to a control file?
[2016-05-12 19:51:31 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] namely https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/a/allegro4.4/control-2%3A4.4.2-8
[2016-05-12 19:51:39 -0500] [naptastic in #debian] markybob, thanks, forgot :)
[2016-05-12 19:56:22 -0500] [mutante in #debian] Mason963: you can subscribe on the list for the maintainers of the package, it's at http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-games-devel
[2016-05-12 19:57:46 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] mutante: thanks for the pointer. Someone in #allegro said he opened a bug against the package
[2016-05-12 19:57:48 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=824157
[2016-05-12 19:58:23 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] does it help to send a trivial patch as well? (I guess the problem is not so much the patch, as to why the decision was made)
[2016-05-12 19:58:56 -0500] [mutante in #debian] Mason963: yea, i think the best way is if you mail that list and decribe it with as much detail as possible and attach the proposed patch
[2016-05-12 19:59:25 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] mutante: OK thanks
[2016-05-12 19:59:31 -0500] [mutante in #debian] and link to the bug too
[2016-05-12 20:00:08 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] mutante: don't the bug reports get sent to the list?
[2016-05-12 20:00:57 -0500] [mutante in #debian] Mason963: eh, yea. they do apparently. you can read the whole archives http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-games-devel/
[2016-05-12 20:01:29 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] yeah I was just looking at the archive for may, and it seems a bit ... not very active
[2016-05-12 20:02:14 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] it's mostly automatic messages from other components
[2016-05-12 20:02:21 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] a quick (i hope) question...booted debian lxde 8.4 live 32bit off usb(unetbootin),on a atom n2600 netbook,does not boot as default so i use the safe mode.but very slow running and looks like only one core is being used when its a dual core ht cpu..any ideas?
[2016-05-12 20:02:31 -0500] [uniqdom in #debian] hello. How to enable direct IO (dio) in php5? which .deb package is needed?
[2016-05-12 20:02:37 -0500] [mutante in #debian] Mason963: make some of the -buntu people use Debian and volunteer :)
[2016-05-12 20:02:39 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] yo whats up my negros
[2016-05-12 20:02:43 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] anybody polish here?
[2016-05-12 20:02:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Ho2k-bug: that's because unetbootin breaks debian's installer
[2016-05-12 20:02:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !unetbootin
[2016-05-12 20:02:47 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] UNetbootin (Universal Netboot Installer) allows creation of bootable USB drives for a variety of Linux distributions.  http://unetbootin.sf.net/  Not recommended for use with Debian CD/DVD images, as it mangles the installer in cruel and unusual ways, resulting in hard to debug problems.  Ask me about <hybrid images>, <usb install>, <win32diskimager>.
[2016-05-12 20:03:03 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Ho2k-bug: are you using windows to copy the image to usb?
[2016-05-12 20:03:26 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] yes markbob
[2016-05-12 20:03:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Ho2k-bug: then you need to use win32diskimager
[2016-05-12 20:03:33 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !win32diskimager
[2016-05-12 20:03:33 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] win32diskimager is much more reliable than <unetbootin> for copying ISO images to USB sticks and you can download it from http://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/ .  Adjust the file mask from *.img to *.* if it doesn't show our .iso images.  See <usb install> and <install debian> for further details.
[2016-05-12 20:03:51 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] mutante: I have a funny story about ubuntu, one of the main kernel devs said they are crazy, and no one wants to work with them
[2016-05-12 20:05:32 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] en polonia ni internet hay
[2016-05-12 20:05:39 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] how about grub4dos,copy iso contents to usb and run g4d on it-eg with puppylinux?
[2016-05-12 20:06:09 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Ho2k-bug: if you have windows just follow the install guide and use win32diskimager. don't make it more complicated.
[2016-05-12 20:06:19 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] ok
[2016-05-12 20:06:21 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] ty
[2016-05-12 20:09:42 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] mutante: one more question, if I look at the tracker for the package https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/allegro5 it lists a repo:
[2016-05-12 20:09:53 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-games/allegro5.git;a=summary
[2016-05-12 20:10:09 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] in which branch do I find the control file?
[2016-05-12 20:10:50 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] master then debian/control
[2016-05-12 20:10:52 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] Doh!
[2016-05-12 20:10:56 -0500] [mutante in #debian] Mason963: i have no idea, "master"?
[2016-05-12 20:11:10 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] yeah, it was hiding in plain sight :-)
[2016-05-12 20:12:35 -0500] [Mason963 in #debian] I'll send a patch to the authors tomorrow, thanks for the help mutante
[2016-05-12 20:13:17 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] what you mean guy?
[2016-05-12 20:14:08 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] wrong channel
[2016-05-12 20:14:30 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] xD
[2016-05-12 20:16:35 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] yeah i know
[2016-05-12 20:16:44 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] some guy from /chat/ told me to try this chan
[2016-05-12 20:16:59 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] because, and i quote, 'there is life of polish origins there'
[2016-05-12 20:17:37 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] this is the offtopic channel
[2016-05-12 20:17:47 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] ahh
[2016-05-12 20:18:14 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] anything goes here, am guessing
[2016-05-12 20:18:29 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] yeah, im sure it does
[2016-05-12 20:18:33 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] btw debian's cool
[2016-05-12 20:18:41 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] i respect your choice %)
[2016-05-12 20:18:45 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] more of a mint-man myself
[2016-05-12 20:19:28 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] https://ptpb.pw/D6NY.png a word-cloud i just made off the most used words in this channel from this morning https://ptpb.pw/D6NY.png
[2016-05-12 20:19:34 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] ups
[2016-05-12 20:31:07 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] written in what?
[2016-05-12 20:31:11 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] looks cool
[2016-05-12 20:31:13 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] >vegan kek
[2016-05-12 20:31:17 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] did you write the script?
[2016-05-12 20:32:18 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] no, someone else
[2016-05-12 20:33:02 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
[2016-05-12 20:33:14 -0500] [n0r in #debian-offtopic] you're so silly
[2016-05-12 20:44:04 -0500] [sn0wmonster in #debian-offtopic] I wonder if running a script against chat logs here and publishing it online could be considered "logging channel without permission"
[2016-05-12 20:44:14 -0500] [sn0wmonster in #debian-offtopic] shrugs
[2016-05-12 20:46:53 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] haha! my plan to dominate the word-cloud with food words has succeeded!
[2016-05-12 20:46:54 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] anyone know why I can't load the 'nvidia' module on jessie using the nvidia-legacy pkgs?
[2016-05-12 20:47:24 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] anyone know exactly how the aliasing for 'nvidia-legacy-340xx' -> 'nvidia'  should actually work?
[2016-05-12 20:48:07 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] lsmod shows me 'nvidia' is there, but when X goes to use it, it fails to load?
[2016-05-12 20:48:55 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] are kittens gluten-free?
[2016-05-12 20:49:04 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] I have two Debian boxes. One is my old box (Wheezy), one is new (Jessie). For some reason, TERM seems to be screwed up on my new Jessie boxes. On both Jessie and Wheezy, TERM reports as xterm. On Jessie, however, this is causing several annoying issues, including: home / end keys not working, pasting in vim results in pasted content being executed outside of insert mode (even with :set paste), broken 256color support. All of these problems
[2016-05-12 20:49:04 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] appear to be completely resolved by manually overriding TERM to screen(-256color)
[2016-05-12 20:49:06 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] dkms happily builds the module
[2016-05-12 20:49:19 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] But the thing is... I'm not using screen. Or tmux, or anything of the sort o_O
[2016-05-12 20:49:29 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] cerebro_: did you make an xorg.conf file?
[2016-05-12 20:49:43 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] that was more tl;dr than I anticipated
[2016-05-12 20:50:11 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] xorg.conf, referencing the 'nvidia' driver is in place (generated using 'nvidia-xconfig')
[2016-05-12 20:51:04 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] modinfo 'nvidia' fails, but modinfo 'nvidia-legacy-340xx' is ok
[2016-05-12 20:51:11 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] It may not even be related to Jessie vs. Wheezy though, maybe my datacenter did something weird when they set up my new boxes, but I have no idea what it is they could have done
[2016-05-12 20:51:17 -0500] [cerebro_ in #debian] it seems like an alias isn't there somehow
[2016-05-12 20:51:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Kirito: this is wa local shell in a terminal emulator you're talking about?
[2016-05-12 20:51:45 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] jmcnaught, Yes, connecting over SSH (even though I've been told a million times that's not at all relevant)
[2016-05-12 20:52:04 -0500] [Kirito in #debian] Mate Terminal / VTE, works fine in Wheezy with seemingly the same setup, I can't find any obvious differences
[2016-05-12 20:52:12 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught just for you to know, I've formatted host with jessie defaults, installed just qemu-kvm, libvirt-bin, firmware-linux-nonfree and firmware-realtek, during the installation of the guest I get kernel panics, but the installation seems more stable overall
[2016-05-12 20:52:43 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught I guess it is time to test my hardware and exclude that possibility from the list
[2016-05-12 20:53:12 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Kirito: i usually use gnome-terminal and terminator (in gnome on jessie) and i haven't noticed any problems. maybe test with a brand new user account to see if it's a local per-user config issue?
[2016-05-12 20:54:34 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] also thanks for your patience hehe
[2016-05-12 20:54:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: are you creating the guest domain using virt-manager GUI? Do you have a Debian desktop system you could test with to try and reproduce?
[2016-05-12 20:55:17 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: unless it's some choice you're making while creating the VM.. you've tried sticking as close to defaults as possible?
[2016-05-12 20:55:42 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught yes for the former, no for the latter, but I guess I can come up with something
[2016-05-12 20:57:03 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught it is basically default, I choose "local media install", pick the image file, set OS as Linux, set Version as Debian Wheezy or later, pick the storage and done
[2016-05-12 20:58:09 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught libvirtd seems to be stopping randomly as well, because I sometimes I get disconnected from qemu:///system
[2016-05-12 20:59:09 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: that's interesting. on the host you could look at "journalctl -b -u libvirtd" for clues
[2016-05-12 21:02:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] that's why I think something might be wrong with hardware
[2016-05-12 21:02:13 -0500] [cmhobbs in #debian-offtopic] they are, indeed
[2016-05-12 21:02:19 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught well, I see a few of these: May 12 22:32:26 morpheu libvirtd[682]: End of file while reading data: Input/output error
[2016-05-12 21:02:25 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] that's not good..
[2016-05-12 21:05:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: i have some of those too actually so they might be red herrings
[2016-05-12 21:05:32 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught hum..
[2016-05-12 21:07:05 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: how much RAM are you giving the guest while installing?
[2016-05-12 21:07:29 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught host has 4GB, I'm setting 1524MB for the guest
[2016-05-12 21:08:20 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: and this host is a box you have physical access to, or a dedicated server in some datacentre?
[2016-05-12 21:08:50 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught it's a box I have physical access to
[2016-05-12 21:09:15 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: is the host low on memory_
[2016-05-12 21:09:59 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] I've installed debian successfully with just 256MB memory on the guest
[2016-05-12 21:10:08 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK doesn't seem like it, I've installed only standard system tools, ssh server and xorg to be able to run virt-manager
[2016-05-12 21:10:21 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] on the host I mean
[2016-05-12 21:10:26 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] what is output of 'free'?
[2016-05-12 21:10:28 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] !pastebin

[2016-05-12 21:11:46 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] so that's obviously not the problem ;)
[2016-05-12 21:12:35 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] motherboard chipset is P35 (ICH9), could that be the problem? although I'm leaving default while creating a VM (i440x)
[2016-05-12 21:13:08 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] if the problem is with the guest, I doubt the mobo is the source of the issue
[2016-05-12 21:13:37 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] at this point I don't know where the problem is anymore..
[2016-05-12 21:13:44 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] host seems stable
[2016-05-12 21:14:00 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: anything in dmesg on the host?
[2016-05-12 21:14:03 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] except from the libvirtd stopping and restarting
[2016-05-12 21:15:13 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: dmesg | pastebinit
[2016-05-12 21:15:21 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK http://codepad.org/nN4t2Ho0
[2016-05-12 21:15:46 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: perhaps use dmesg -T
[2016-05-12 21:15:56 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: but doesn't look like anything in there
[2016-05-12 21:16:07 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK that's what I thought..
[2016-05-12 21:17:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I wish someone had a spare machine so he/she could try to reproduce my problems
[2016-05-12 21:17:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] I haven't read the full history - could you summarise, please?
[2016-05-12 21:19:46 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK sure, I'm installing Debian 8.4 on this computer to learn how to use KVM, so I've downloaded latest Debian 8.4 netinst, put it on a flash drive and installed on the host. First time I used the kernel from backports, and as I'm new and having all kinds of problems, I've decided to start over with Debian 8.4 with its defaults
[2016-05-12 21:20:38 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK I've partitioned my harddrive as this: Created a host-vg and put /, /home and swap there, created another vg for the VMs
[2016-05-12 21:21:03 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] another VG or LV?
[2016-05-12 21:21:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] VG
[2016-05-12 21:21:14 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] no reason to use two VGs on the same disk
[2016-05-12 21:21:18 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: you're using this exact image: http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso and not some other netboot or mini.iso?
[2016-05-12 21:21:22 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] but then, that shouldn't matter
[2016-05-12 21:21:29 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught yes
[2016-05-12 21:21:35 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] exactly that image
[2016-05-12 21:21:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: have you tried booting a debian live cd to see if it works?
[2016-05-12 21:22:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] not for the installation, just to see if it runs okay
[2016-05-12 21:22:10 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught no, but I guess I can do it :)
[2016-05-12 21:22:18 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] usually just uses CD1 for installations in case networking is messed up
[2016-05-12 21:22:41 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK well, that's the summary of my story :)
[2016-05-12 21:23:03 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] oh and host hardware is: Q6600, 4GB (2x2GB) and 500GB HDD
[2016-05-12 21:23:06 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: I can't see a reason for things failing
[2016-05-12 21:23:16 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] should work
[2016-05-12 21:23:22 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] yes :(
[2016-05-12 21:24:04 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] as for LVM, just use a single PV per disk
[2016-05-12 21:24:14 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] and a single VG for that disk
[2016-05-12 21:24:23 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] and just use separate LVs on top of that
[2016-05-12 21:24:36 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] not directly related to your problems, though
[2016-05-12 21:24:57 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] the idea for the separate VG for libvirt came from me, so that members of the libvirt group can't do things to the LVs for root and swap
[2016-05-12 21:25:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK I was advised to use two, so that, when using the VG as storage pool, / and /home wouldn't be seen
[2016-05-12 21:25:29 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] is this image ok? http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-8.4.0-amd64-lxde-desktop.iso
[2016-05-12 21:26:06 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: should do - or use the official one - or are you using desktop on these VMs?
[2016-05-12 21:26:27 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK I'm not, it will be my application server
[2016-05-12 21:26:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] jmcnaught: a kvm guest won't have access to the host's LVM setup
[2016-05-12 21:26:38 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: for testing, sure. also at what point does the installer kernel panic, and are you able able to show us the errors from the guest's console?
[2016-05-12 21:27:08 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] RoyK: i know, what i mean is not being able to see the host's LVs in the libvirt storage pool
[2016-05-12 21:27:24 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught the installer panics while installing the packages
[2016-05-12 21:27:34 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] after tasksel
[2016-05-12 21:27:36 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] jmcnaught: that doesn't matter much - really
[2016-05-12 21:27:55 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: just install the guest with ssh and basic stuff only - install the rest later
[2016-05-12 21:28:09 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK that's what I'm trying to do
[2016-05-12 21:28:19 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] ok
[2016-05-12 21:28:22 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I only select ssh server and standard system utilities
[2016-05-12 21:28:24 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: i was having strange crashes on my laptop until i installed the intel microcode package from non-free
[2016-05-12 21:28:33 -0500] [robysath in #debian] aptitude shows GPG error for APT.spideroak.com. Is this related to SHA1 as per debian wiki? Looks like they were contacted so do I just ignore this until "they" fix it or is there something I should do manually?
[2016-05-12 21:28:44 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] RoyK: no it doesn't really matter, i just like to keep things logically separated
[2016-05-12 21:28:51 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] jmcnaught: that shouldn't be needed on a vm :P
[2016-05-12 21:29:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] robysath: if you're using testing, yes. and this isn't testing support. /topic
[2016-05-12 21:29:13 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] jmcnaught: an lv is logically separated from another vm
[2016-05-12 21:29:43 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught do I need to reboot after installing intel-microcode?
[2016-05-12 21:29:47 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] jmcnaught: personally, I like things to be separated a bit more - like physical disks for the root and a zpool or an mdraid for the data or VMs
[2016-05-12 21:29:58 -0500] [robysath in #debian] markybob: i'm not using testing, i'm using jessie
[2016-05-12 21:30:12 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] !testing
[2016-05-12 21:30:12 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Testing is a continuously updated release between <stable> and <unstable>, currently codenamed <stretch>. See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting . Support in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net and ask me about <testing faq> <jessie->stretch> <testing security> <moving target> <apt-listchanges> <apt-listbugs> and <bts>. You need a sound knowledge of Debian and be prepared for a very bumpy ride. Don't use it on things that are critical!
[2016-05-12 21:30:34 -0500] [markybob in #debian] robysath: jessie still uses sha1 with repos
[2016-05-12 21:30:50 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] markybob: erm - kidding me?
[2016-05-12 21:31:05 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] better go back to md5 to make things even worse :P
[2016-05-12 21:31:10 -0500] [markybob in #debian] RoyK: i try not to kid
[2016-05-12 21:31:44 -0500] [robysath in #debian] markybob: thanks. debian wiki says repo owners should make sure their release files and packages contain SHA256/512. So should I just ignore error or do something manually?
[2016-05-12 21:31:53 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] and des56 for password encryption - yey!
[2016-05-12 21:31:59 -0500] [markybob in #debian] robysath: ignore until they fix their shit, i guess.
[2016-05-12 21:32:57 -0500] [robysath in #debian] I presume others on jessie should have same warn/error right?
[2016-05-12 21:33:14 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] do I need to reboot after installing intel-microcode?
[2016-05-12 21:33:16 -0500] [markybob in #debian] robysath: i don't, but you have a frankendebian which isn't supported anyway
[2016-05-12 21:33:22 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !tell robysath abou dontbreakdebian
[2016-05-12 21:33:31 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !tell robysath about frankendebian
[2016-05-12 21:33:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !tell robysath about dontbreakdebian
[2016-05-12 21:34:17 -0500] [robysath in #debian] markybob: ah, i'm getting the picture :)
[2016-05-12 21:34:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: yes you need to reboot
[2016-05-12 21:34:42 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught got it, I will wait iso download to finish and reboot
[2016-05-12 21:35:36 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: it might not help, and i would kinda expect you to notice other problems if this were the issue, but it's worth a try
[2016-05-12 21:36:38 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] jmcnaught sure
[2016-05-12 21:36:56 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I wish I had another and better hardware to test it
[2016-05-12 21:37:17 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] 2010ish hardware is hum.. old
[2016-05-12 21:37:27 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] even older
[2016-05-12 21:37:53 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] 2007ish :P
[2016-05-12 21:38:23 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: do you have ECC memory on that one?
[2016-05-12 21:38:29 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Devastator: you could also try looking at "journalctl -xn 50" to see the 50 most recent entries after the problem happens, see if there's IO errors on the host or something
[2016-05-12 21:38:33 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK unfortunately no
[2016-05-12 21:38:43 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: old hardware isn't necessarily bad
[2016-05-12 21:39:17 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I really thought this hardware would be capable of running 1 or 2 VMs in a decent way
[2016-05-12 21:39:22 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] (unless you drag your old i486 with its 8MBs of RAM into here)
[2016-05-12 21:39:49 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: does it have hardware virtualisation support?
[2016-05-12 21:40:34 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK yup
[2016-05-12 21:40:54 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] intel or amd?
[2016-05-12 21:41:04 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] Intel Core2Quad Q6600
[2016-05-12 21:41:22 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] is vmx listed under flags in /proc/cpuinfo?
[2016-05-12 21:43:03 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK http://codepad.org/FZylauwD
[2016-05-12 21:43:21 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] ok
[2016-05-12 21:43:30 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] ty markybob, alls good.
[2016-05-12 21:43:35 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Hello everyone
[2016-05-12 21:43:55 -0500] [markybob in #debian] Ho2K-Bug: yay
[2016-05-12 21:43:58 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: again - if you try to install that guest, where does it fail? is it random, or at a certain point?
[2016-05-12 21:44:43 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i know smart errors can be stupid and not real...but the input/output errors he posted...i don't know.
[2016-05-12 21:44:44 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK usually while installing the packages after tasksel
[2016-05-12 21:44:55 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Would anyone be kind enough to help me with a little problem?
[2016-05-12 21:45:01 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: usually?
[2016-05-12 21:45:16 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK yes
[2016-05-12 21:45:24 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jaymaker, as long as it is not windows, then i suppose maybe.
[2016-05-12 21:45:36 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jaymaker, but it it to be about debian
[2016-05-12 21:45:47 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: I wrote this little thing to just stress the memory of a runnning system https://www.karlsbakk.net/memstress/
[2016-05-12 21:45:48 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK, jmcnaught, live image gave a kernel panic about not being able to mount root
[2016-05-12 21:45:48 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Ugh! Hence why I'm in the debian channel :P
[2016-05-12 21:45:57 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jaymaker: you'd be surprised
[2016-05-12 21:46:09 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Anyways, I can't seem to update. I'll try to update and I get this error
[2016-05-12 21:46:12 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] Error while installing package: trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp8-platform.so.2.0.1', which is also in package libp8-platform2v4
[2016-05-12 21:46:13 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: you may want to try it to see if it can panic you machine
[2016-05-12 21:46:28 -0500] [markybob in #debian] !tell jaymaker about bat
[2016-05-12 21:46:31 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: or you may want to power down the system and run memtest86 on it
[2016-05-12 21:46:41 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] bat?
[2016-05-12 21:46:44 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jaymaker: read what the bot said and provide that info
[2016-05-12 21:46:45 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK yes, that's what I thought..
[2016-05-12 21:47:26 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] a bitflip in memory can be rather bad
[2016-05-12 21:47:33 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] OH! Sorry
[2016-05-12 21:47:40 -0500] [markybob in #debian] everything about it yells hardware
[2016-05-12 21:48:20 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] a good bat is good hardware when some rightwing people come up close
[2016-05-12 21:49:43 -0500] [markybob in #debian] RoyK: um...i think you got it mixed up. the hardware wasn't about bat. Devastator
[2016-05-12 21:50:12 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] markybob: no, I didn't mix things up, I was making a wee joke ;)
[2016-05-12 21:50:23 -0500] [markybob in #debian] oh. too late for that here :P sorry
[2016-05-12 21:51:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] someone might have to take over for me anyway. pretty tired. just fyi jaymaker
[2016-05-12 21:51:40 -0500] [jaymaker in #debian] thanks anyways marky
[2016-05-12 21:51:49 -0500] [Ho2k-bug in #debian] same
[2016-05-12 21:51:52 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] markybob: np :)
[2016-05-12 21:58:28 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: did you try a memtest?
[2016-05-12 21:58:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] damn i hadn't quit on him yet...and there are a ton of people here
[2016-05-12 21:59:13 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK I will have to try tomorrow because the computer is at my work..
[2016-05-12 21:59:40 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] I'm accessing it from my work computer via teamviewer hehe
[2016-05-12 21:59:52 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: ok - try that memstress thing - just set vm.panic = 10 and vm.panic_on_oops = 1 first - see sysctl
[2016-05-12 22:00:13 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] erm
[2016-05-12 22:00:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] kernel.panic, and kernel.panic_on_oops, not vm.
[2016-05-12 22:01:06 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] just in case the thing crashes, it'll reboot and hopefully come up again as it should
[2016-05-12 22:01:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] I've seen that program break systems with bad memory a few times
[2016-05-12 22:02:04 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK gcc -o memstress.c?
[2016-05-12 22:02:21 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] download the files from https://www.karlsbakk.net/memstress/
[2016-05-12 22:02:26 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] and run a "make"
[2016-05-12 22:02:33 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] right :P
[2016-05-12 22:02:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] you only need the .c file and the makefile
[2016-05-12 22:03:14 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] I haven't touched the code for years, but it should work
[2016-05-12 22:05:11 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK how do I set kernel.panic and kernel.panic_on_oops?
[2016-05-12 22:05:16 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] export?
[2016-05-12 22:06:15 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: vi /etc/sysctl.d/01-mystuff.conf
[2016-05-12 22:06:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] add kernel.panic = 10 and kernel.panic_on_oops = 1 on separate lines
[2016-05-12 22:06:51 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] run sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/01-mystuff.conf
[2016-05-12 22:07:59 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] you can do it manually too - just echo 10 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic
[2016-05-12 22:08:00 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] etc
[2016-05-12 22:08:07 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] but that won't last over a reboot
[2016-05-12 22:08:21 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] your program is running
[2016-05-12 22:08:36 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] got the panic setting?
[2016-05-12 22:08:42 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] yup
[2016-05-12 22:08:55 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] hopefully something will happen :)
[2016-05-12 22:09:12 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] seems to me something is bad with your hardware
[2016-05-12 22:09:17 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK http://codepad.org/ViT0mPP5
[2016-05-12 22:09:31 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] time to wait hehe
[2016-05-12 22:09:38 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] use a few more passes
[2016-05-12 22:10:03 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] iirc there's a -p -1 or something there to use indefinete passes - don't remember
[2016-05-12 22:10:40 -0500] [RoyK in #debian]                 printf("    -p <passes> - set to -1 for infinite test\n");
[2016-05-12 22:10:42 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] yes
[2016-05-12 22:11:10 -0500] [ataldis in #debian] i have intermitent problems with my front audio panel... any tips on diagnosing it?
[2016-05-12 22:11:46 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK started again with -p -1, but first time passed
[2016-05-12 22:11:52 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] ok
[2016-05-12 22:11:55 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] well
[2016-05-12 22:12:04 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] I'll be off to be soon
[2016-05-12 22:12:15 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] me too, 00:12 here :(
[2016-05-12 22:12:15 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] that program should need a little rewrite
[2016-05-12 22:12:30 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Devastator: where is that?
[2016-05-12 22:12:38 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] brazil
[2016-05-12 22:12:42 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] ok
[2016-05-12 22:13:53 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] nite
[2016-05-12 22:14:00 -0500] [ataldis in #debian] ah, hora de dormir mesmo, então. rs
[2016-05-12 22:15:44 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] RoyK thanks! nite!
[2016-05-12 22:22:05 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] well thats happened re-installed debian lastnight and im using more ram then i was on my old install
[2016-05-12 22:22:09 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] How does that work ._.
[2016-05-12 22:23:52 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] and it has less processes than the old one xD
[2016-05-12 22:25:54 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] wait it might not be
[2016-05-12 22:34:19 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] hypermist, what do you mean by "using more ram"?
[2016-05-12 22:34:47 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] hypermist, either you installed different debian (jessie vs wheezy), went 64bit instead of 32, or you're counting disk cache...
[2016-05-12 22:35:48 -0500] [toruvinn in #debian] or you can have different kernel, different buffers set, literally whatever. ;-P
[2016-05-12 22:40:21 -0500] [hypermist in #debian] i used jessie 64bit and it says rsys is using 182mb
[2016-05-12 23:14:35 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Hello, there!  I have just installed Debian for the first time and am having a lot of problems.  I have managed to figure them out with the exception of whenever I try to use apt-get or aptitude or dpkg to install any packages I get the error message, "cannot execute binary file".  search results don't seem to be relevant to my issue.  Can anyone p
[2016-05-12 23:14:35 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oint me in the right direction?
[2016-05-12 23:15:16 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: which iso did you use?
[2016-05-12 23:15:37 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] uhhm
[2016-05-12 23:16:05 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] On Debian's site, I downloaded the DVD rom of the AMD64 version, and then dded it to a flash drive
[2016-05-12 23:16:20 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] does that answer your question?
[2016-05-12 23:16:25 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: no
[2016-05-12 23:16:33 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] how can I figure that out?
[2016-05-12 23:16:46 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: i assume you look at wherever you downloaded it to
[2016-05-12 23:16:55 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: we have broken iso's is why i ask
[2016-05-12 23:17:01 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: are you trying to install 32bit binaries?
[2016-05-12 23:17:06 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] are you wanting the filename?
[2016-05-12 23:17:12 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] no, it's 64
[2016-05-12 23:17:19 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: i want the filename and full url if you have it
[2016-05-12 23:17:42 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: and your machine is 64bit?
[2016-05-12 23:17:54 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] yes
[2016-05-12 23:18:22 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] The site is https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/ and it is the DVD of the AMD64 version.
[2016-05-12 23:18:41 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: no. doesn't answer the question.
[2016-05-12 23:18:56 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: that site has links to broken iso's
[2016-05-12 23:19:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, they're asking if you installed anything outside debian repositories
[2016-05-12 23:19:07 -0500] [markybob in #debian] not at all what i'm asking
[2016-05-12 23:19:16 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] and the iso is  debian-8.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso
[2016-05-12 23:19:29 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I am unable to install anything.  It is a fresh install.
[2016-05-12 23:19:30 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: and your exact command to copy it over was?
[2016-05-12 23:19:56 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I don't remember. :(
[2016-05-12 23:19:57 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: sha256sum on that?
[2016-05-12 23:20:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, the error for a non setup apt, is not a binary execution failure, unless you don't have root privilege
[2016-05-12 23:20:49 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] RoyK, I'm sorry?
[2016-05-12 23:20:59 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: if you follow the install guide you'd do cp debian-8.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso /dev/sdX (not /dev/sdX1, block device, not partition)
[2016-05-12 23:21:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] brownchickenbrow: plus you do a sha256sum to make sure the download wasn't corrupted
[2016-05-12 23:21:31 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: check the checksum of the iso before you use it
[2016-05-12 23:22:08 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: *always* do that - really
[2016-05-12 23:22:33 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Okay.  In the future I will look up how to do that.
[2016-05-12 23:22:35 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: doesn't matter what distro or OS - just check it
[2016-05-12 23:22:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] if im correct, i think he said he installed debian
[2016-05-12 23:22:58 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] yeah, I'm using it to talk to you guys
[2016-05-12 23:22:59 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] right now
[2016-05-12 23:23:08 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i don't really cared if he installed a unicorn. he can't answer basic questions so we can't answer
[2016-05-12 23:23:09 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, that error i mentioned previously
[2016-05-12 23:23:17 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, apt by default does not have its sources.list fully setup
[2016-05-12 23:23:24 -0500] [markybob in #debian] he needs to answer those basic things before we can help
[2016-05-12 23:23:27 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] creates a new super-debian iso to redistribute to brownchickenbrow with a lot of super-extra software in it
[2016-05-12 23:23:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, (by default only a cdrom source would be set)
[2016-05-12 23:23:42 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jml2: that wouldn't give that error
[2016-05-12 23:23:53 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, so ask for a pastebin
[2016-05-12 23:23:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, maybe he's not quoting it properly
[2016-05-12 23:24:02 -0500] [markybob in #debian] basics first
[2016-05-12 23:24:10 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I'm really sorry guys, I am really trying here.  I don't understand what you are asking of me
[2016-05-12 23:24:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] there's no point to move on if you don't know where you're starting from
[2016-05-12 23:24:19 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] markybob: such as supheric acid? ;)
[2016-05-12 23:24:30 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, that's why you ask for a pastebin
[2016-05-12 23:24:32 -0500] [markybob in #debian] RoyK: now that one i got :P
[2016-05-12 23:24:35 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] no, wait, that's not basic
[2016-05-12 23:24:52 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jml2: pastebin won't answer the questions i've asked
[2016-05-12 23:24:58 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, it would.
[2016-05-12 23:25:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, you ask for a checksum pastebin.
[2016-05-12 23:25:05 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jml2: okay. you can have this one. enjoy
[2016-05-12 23:25:10 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] :/
[2016-05-12 23:25:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, you don't seem efficient lol
[2016-05-12 23:25:30 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] tells markybob to take a break!
[2016-05-12 23:25:36 -0500] [markybob in #debian] the whole point of asking basics is to be efficient and not waste time.
[2016-05-12 23:25:47 -0500] [markybob in #debian] what you're talking about is nonsense
[2016-05-12 23:26:05 -0500] [markybob in #debian] sources.list doesn't cause that error because of dvd
[2016-05-12 23:26:06 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, to the point he even mentions he has debian installed and is using atm for irc?
[2016-05-12 23:26:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] markybob, that's a little too far-fetched imho
[2016-05-12 23:26:33 -0500] [markybob in #debian] have fun then
[2016-05-12 23:27:24 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, do you know what a checksum is? and its purpose?
[2016-05-12 23:28:09 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I'm really sorry I caused this to happen.  I have been using ubuntu for about 6 months and thought that I was ready to try Debian.  I am really confused and don't know what I am doing to make things difficult.  I'm really sorry I don't understand. :(
[2016-05-12 23:28:17 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Yes.  I don't know how to check one
[2016-05-12 23:28:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, md5sum file.iso
[2016-05-12 23:28:29 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jml2, yes
[2016-05-12 23:28:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, there's winmd5sum for windows
[2016-05-12 23:28:46 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, the md5sums will be in the same directory you downloaded the iso
[2016-05-12 23:28:47 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] ...is that a command?
[2016-05-12 23:28:50 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, y
[2016-05-12 23:28:55 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, or "md5"
[2016-05-12 23:29:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, i think its md5 on osx.. i dunno what you used as the downloading platform..
[2016-05-12 23:29:35 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, and there's sha256sum -- which you can check against the sh256sums file from the download directory
[2016-05-12 23:29:48 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, it's the same thing.. but using a different algorithm checksum
[2016-05-12 23:29:51 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] uhh, I was using ubuntu
[2016-05-12 23:30:01 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, you only need to verify just 1 checksum algo
[2016-05-12 23:30:33 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] So I should open a terminal on my other computer where I originally downloaded Debian and type in "md5sum <filename>", the filename being the Debian iso?
[2016-05-12 23:30:43 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, y
[2016-05-12 23:30:52 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Thank you, I will do that now
[2016-05-12 23:32:02 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, then you compare that output with http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/MD5SUMS
[2016-05-12 23:32:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, or the dvd which is elsewhere
[2016-05-12 23:32:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.4.0/amd64/iso-dvd/MD5SUMS
[2016-05-12 23:34:03 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] The numbers are the same.
[2016-05-12 23:34:22 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] That means the file is complete, yes?
[2016-05-12 23:35:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, y
[2016-05-12 23:35:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, so you have to setup your apt..
[2016-05-12 23:35:48 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, did you use sudo or "root" with apt-get ?
[2016-05-12 23:35:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, here's what i do
[2016-05-12 23:36:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, i just lazily do this at the start then fine tune it later
[2016-05-12 23:36:26 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I used "su <username>" because it seems I don't have sudo installed
[2016-05-12 23:36:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, cp /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/
[2016-05-12 23:36:44 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] lazy sounds good.  I'm a beginner.
[2016-05-12 23:36:46 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, apt-get update, apt-get install netselect-apt
[2016-05-12 23:36:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, after i fine-tune it
[2016-05-12 23:37:14 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] so the problem is that I can't install anything or update, or I get that error
[2016-05-12 23:37:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, try logging in as root
[2016-05-12 23:37:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, (not sudo)
[2016-05-12 23:37:51 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] uhm
[2016-05-12 23:37:57 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] like in a virtual terminal?
[2016-05-12 23:38:02 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, y in terminal
[2016-05-12 23:38:06 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, can be in xterm as well
[2016-05-12 23:38:16 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] because I am not presented with the option in the GUI when I boot
[2016-05-12 23:38:18 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, (xterm=gui terminal)
[2016-05-12 23:38:26 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oh, I can do it in xterm?
[2016-05-12 23:38:38 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] what command is used?
[2016-05-12 23:38:43 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, "su "
[2016-05-12 23:38:47 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, then type root's passwd
[2016-05-12 23:38:54 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] su root?
[2016-05-12 23:38:58 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oh
[2016-05-12 23:39:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, you can use "su -l" i think -- that might be better
[2016-05-12 23:39:20 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oh, ok, I'm in
[2016-05-12 23:39:25 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oh, too late
[2016-05-12 23:39:31 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] should I try it again with that argument?
[2016-05-12 23:39:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, you can if you want
[2016-05-12 23:39:45 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, ctl-d logs out
[2016-05-12 23:39:47 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] what does it do?
[2016-05-12 23:39:48 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, or type logout
[2016-05-12 23:39:54 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] is that an L or an i?
[2016-05-12 23:39:56 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, su is for switiching to root account
[2016-05-12 23:40:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, small l
[2016-05-12 23:40:10 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I mean the argument
[2016-05-12 23:40:11 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] what does IT do?
[2016-05-12 23:40:17 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, already told ya
[2016-05-12 23:40:39 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, if you need help on "-l" , you can use "man su"
[2016-05-12 23:40:46 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, and type "q" to exit the manpage viewer
[2016-05-12 23:40:53 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] brownchickenbrow: what does IT do? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksCTVFtjM4
[2016-05-12 23:40:56 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, that gives details on the options
[2016-05-12 23:41:32 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, -l can sometimes help to ensure the environment is set properly for the login user
[2016-05-12 23:41:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, cp /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/
[2016-05-12 23:41:57 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I'm sorry, I'm waay behind you
[2016-05-12 23:41:59 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I can't log out
[2016-05-12 23:42:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, apt-get update, apt-get install netselect-apt
[2016-05-12 23:42:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, then debian is not for you
[2016-05-12 23:42:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, doing a checksum is much more harder.. if you can do that, you should be able to do this as well
[2016-05-12 23:42:58 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] brownchickenbrow, are you trolling?
[2016-05-12 23:43:38 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Okay, I was trying to be patient and polite, because you were trying to help me, but you are being a complete jerk
[2016-05-12 23:43:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] !ops brownchickenbrow trolling
[2016-05-12 23:43:49 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Hydroxide, dondelelcaro, LoRez, RichiH, mentor, abrotman, Maulkin, stew, peterS, Myon, Ganneff, weasel, zobel, themill, babilen, SynrG, jm_, somiaj, jelly: jml2 complains about: brownchickenbrow trolling
[2016-05-12 23:43:50 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] you are not explaining yourself clearly
[2016-05-12 23:43:52 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I am not an idiot
[2016-05-12 23:44:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] ignores brownchickenbrow 
[2016-05-12 23:44:51 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: hey why don't you start again with putting the command you used and the full output on http://paste.debian.net/ ?
[2016-05-12 23:45:35 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jmcnaught Thank you very much, I will try that now
[2016-05-12 23:48:12 -0500] [aaronm04 in #debian] Is there a lot of breakage with sid over time, compared to rolling distros like Arch and Gentoo?
[2016-05-12 23:48:32 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jmcnaught I'm really sorry, I have never used pastebin before.  I keep getting errors because of the name, and now it says I need two linebreaks because of spammers?
[2016-05-12 23:48:58 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: how long is the paste you are trying to make?
[2016-05-12 23:49:09 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] two lines.
[2016-05-12 23:49:27 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Could I post it here maybe?
[2016-05-12 23:50:11 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] or; how do I add a line break? is it like an html tag?
[2016-05-12 23:50:17 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] sure, two lines is fine in the channel, more than that use the paste site
[2016-05-12 23:50:49 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Oh, I finally got it to work
[2016-05-12 23:50:53 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] what do I do, give you the url?
[2016-05-12 23:51:01 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] yup
[2016-05-12 23:51:28 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Thank you so much for your patience, I'm really sorry I'm making so much trouble
[2016-05-12 23:51:32 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] http://paste.debian.net/683675/
[2016-05-12 23:53:02 -0500] [deb in #debian] Oo
[2016-05-12 23:53:12 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: so you're typing "su cwons apt-get update" cwons looks like your username. it also seems that you are already root. can you please try just "apt-get update" without the "su cwons" at the start?
[2016-05-12 23:53:57 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] oh wow! that worked!
[2016-05-12 23:54:09 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I was not root when I tried that earlier
[2016-05-12 23:56:11 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] so should I just log into root whenever I want to install something?
[2016-05-12 23:57:09 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: only root can install stuff. you can become root with "su -l" (and then enter root password). When you are root the last character of your prompt changes from a $ to a #
[2016-05-12 23:57:49 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: you can also install sudo if you're more familiar with that. "apt-get install sudo" and then "adduser cwons sudo" to put your user in the sudo group
[2016-05-12 23:59:02 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I was tying su <user> before, but I did not use the -i.  I checked the man page and I do not see a -i argument listed anywhere.  This is when that other guy thought I was trolling
[2016-05-12 23:59:04 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: since you're new and all, there's a lot of great material here especially the handbook and reference: https://www.debian.org/doc/
[2016-05-12 23:59:20 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] Oh, thank you!
[2016-05-12 23:59:48 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I am very thorough with documentation, I will definitely go through this
[2016-05-13 00:00:03 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: that's "su -l" small l short for login. The reason you don't put a username in the command is because you want to become root, which is the default
[2016-05-13 00:00:33 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] "su -" is the same as "su -l"
[2016-05-13 00:00:35 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] OH
[2016-05-13 00:00:35 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] That makes sense!
[2016-05-13 00:01:20 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I tried installing sudo, and it asked me to insert the disc that contains it...
[2016-05-13 00:02:27 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: well you can do that, or you can edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file to remove the CD-ROM lines. I recommend making it look like the example on this page: https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList
[2016-05-13 00:06:46 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] So all my other sources are commented out.  Could that be because I installed debian offline?
[2016-05-13 00:07:56 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] Hi, does anyone here use the newsbeuter rss feed loader or know a thing about it
[2016-05-13 00:08:34 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: yes. once you make it look like the example on the page i linked to you'll be able to install software from network mirrors

[2016-05-13 00:10:26 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Hello.
[2016-05-13 00:10:51 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] A lady on irc?  Perposterous
[2016-05-13 00:11:00 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jmcnaught Sorry, I had much difficulty in understanding that page.  I have managed to follow the directions and have successfully installed sudo thanks to you!!!
[2016-05-13 00:11:11 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Not really.
[2016-05-13 00:11:23 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jmcnaught Thank you so much!!
[2016-05-13 00:11:44 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I hate people yet I'm on IRC
[2016-05-13 00:11:55 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] figure that one out, maybe it's just being pathetic and lonely I guess
[2016-05-13 00:12:03 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] the two go hand in hand, know what I mean?
[2016-05-13 00:12:06 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Also naturally protruding mammaris helps every once in a while.
[2016-05-13 00:12:39 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] s/mammaris/marraries/;
[2016-05-13 00:12:52 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] my penis is way too small for that
[2016-05-13 00:12:57 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] apparently I'm in hell
[2016-05-13 00:12:58 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] easy Curb with the lady
[2016-05-13 00:13:47 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] As long as you take time in the beginning, size might not matter. 8)
[2016-05-13 00:13:58 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] it's that dang "might"
[2016-05-13 00:14:03 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: you're welcome. stuff will get easier to understand with practice and after you read up on the fundamentals
[2016-05-13 00:14:42 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] jmcnaught I am very excited to go through the documentation
[2016-05-13 00:14:57 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] I love learning about this stuff
[2016-05-13 00:15:13 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] The more you worry about it, the worse it will be for you. If you don't worry and concentrate more on other skills, it will not matter.
[2016-05-13 00:15:37 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: most of the documentation on that debian.org/doc page is also available as packages... debian-handbook and debian-reference for example
[2016-05-13 00:15:56 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] Do you know how difficult keeping this subject "family friendly" is?
[2016-05-13 00:15:59 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] handbook?
[2016-05-13 00:16:11 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] you man like in the man pages?
[2016-05-13 00:16:32 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] It is more about skill than equipment. A small thing can sometimes be very potent. 8)
[2016-05-13 00:17:07 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] brownchickenbrow: man pages are different, i mean https://debian-handbook.info/
[2016-05-13 00:18:22 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] So tortib are you a misanthrope?
[2016-05-13 00:18:51 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] fap,fap,fap ... lol kidding
[2016-05-13 00:18:54 -0500] [brownchickenbrow in #debian] thank you!
[2016-05-13 00:21:39 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] deb: what made you think that any of that last statement was a good idea?
[2016-05-13 00:22:28 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] haha
[2016-05-13 00:22:39 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] i was smoking a cigarette and sorry about not keeping this family friendly, I don't have the topic showing
[2016-05-13 00:22:57 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, you sound educated, using many large words
[2016-05-13 00:23:28 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, I am now, but I wasn't always that way.  Society slowly turned me this way.
[2016-05-13 00:23:41 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Or maybe I was like that all along
[2016-05-13 00:24:19 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] is there a #debian-vice channel for non-family-friendly discussion?
[2016-05-13 00:24:34 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, I read a lot and am exposed to large words at times which get inserted to my normal vocabulary. Some words are express so much in so little space.
[2016-05-13 00:24:48 -0500] [StigAtle in #debian] Good morning
[2016-05-13 00:24:56 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, I look them up, to know what the heck someone is trying to say instead of just saying what they really want to say.
[2016-05-13 00:25:08 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Yall gotta used some big word
[2016-05-13 00:25:37 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, big words are just cooler to use than a bunch of small ones.
[2016-05-13 00:25:51 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I would argue that the degree to which one's speech sounds "sophisticated" has a lot more to do with grammar than with vocabulary.
[2016-05-13 00:25:53 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] yeah but if you're trying to communicate with a normal joe schmo it's tough
[2016-05-13 00:26:09 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] s/grammar/grammar and phrasing/
[2016-05-13 00:26:20 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] yeah it would suck if the language got reduced to only a few thousand small words. doubleplusungood.
[2016-05-13 00:26:29 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, I like expanding people's worlds through vocabulary.
[2016-05-13 00:26:37 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] O.o
[2016-05-13 00:26:42 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, ok
[2016-05-13 00:26:48 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: there's that xkcd book explaining scientific concepts using the 1000 most common English words
[2016-05-13 00:27:01 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I'm on IRC too much, because the other day I instinctively tried to regex-replace something I said out loud
[2016-05-13 00:27:22 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/
[2016-05-13 00:27:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Some people don't like people who use big words :(
[2016-05-13 00:27:43 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] pharpend: there's also a simple english version of wikipedia, but i still respect diction
[2016-05-13 00:27:47 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, also, I've forgotten how to express some ideas in smaller forms, for example, I know what a rhetorical question is, but don't make me define rhetorical.
[2016-05-13 00:28:16 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] there's a growing subset of English experts who argue that simplicity in speech is virtuous, because it allows you to convey to a wider audience
[2016-05-13 00:28:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] It's asking a question that either has no answer or the person asking it doesn't expect a answer
[2016-05-13 00:28:27 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] how difficult is that to explain?
[2016-05-13 00:28:46 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] My view of English writing changed quite a bit when I started studying linguistics
[2016-05-13 00:28:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, um....
[2016-05-13 00:28:53 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] now I hate prescriptive rules with a passion
[2016-05-13 00:30:01 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] For instance, in English, there's no logical reason to not end a phrase with a preposition
[2016-05-13 00:30:29 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't even remember all the prepositional phrases :(
[2016-05-13 00:30:41 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] In Italic languages, it is ungrammatical, but ending phrases with prepositions is fine in English
[2016-05-13 00:30:49 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Guess it makes sense why I'm poor now, lol, just a dumb dude
[2016-05-13 00:30:51 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] passivization is also fine
[2016-05-13 00:31:08 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] tortib: you were smart enough to choose Debian
[2016-05-13 00:31:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't think choosing something takes much intelligence
[2016-05-13 00:31:27 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] but yeah I had debian on my mac pro
[2016-05-13 00:31:36 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] unless you're ... a (whatever Debian's rival distro is) user
[2016-05-13 00:31:39 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] Ubuntu I guess
[2016-05-13 00:31:41 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] no
[2016-05-13 00:31:44 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I'm still new to Debian
[2016-05-13 00:31:46 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I would prefer straight debian
[2016-05-13 00:31:50 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] but I don't like Gnome 3
[2016-05-13 00:31:52 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] not one bit
[2016-05-13 00:32:05 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] i find it difficult to use (mostly because I don't know the keyboard shortcuts)
[2016-05-13 00:32:14 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I used Arch, and it was considered a mortal sin to ever bring up Manjaro
[2016-05-13 00:32:16 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] or Gentoo, even
[2016-05-13 00:32:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] dang
[2016-05-13 00:32:33 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] Manjaro is to Arch (kind of) what Ubuntu is to Debian
[2016-05-13 00:32:40 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] markets itself as more user-friendly
[2016-05-13 00:32:43 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] yeah, same as antergos
[2016-05-13 00:32:43 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i love gnome 3
[2016-05-13 00:32:48 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] hm
[2016-05-13 00:33:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, you need more confidence in yourself. First it is member size and now language usage.
[2016-05-13 00:33:21 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, meh, I don't care
[2016-05-13 00:33:31 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] dammit, all this talk of penis size is going to make me vote for Trump. So let's stop.
[2016-05-13 00:33:37 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I'm confident that I have enough confidence to be able to look at my flaws
[2016-05-13 00:33:43 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, ah, I remember, misanthrope.
[2016-05-13 00:34:07 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] tortib, do you like kittens?
[2016-05-13 00:34:19 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, wasn't always that way ya know, I did actually like people for a while, even when I was treated like crap.  But that has quickly changed
[2016-05-13 00:34:34 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, I'm a dog person
[2016-05-13 00:34:42 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, but my dog thinks its a cat, if that counts
[2016-05-13 00:34:42 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] likes kittens but really doesn't like puppies
[2016-05-13 00:34:46 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] they are very messy
[2016-05-13 00:34:56 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] cats are clean
[2016-05-13 00:35:01 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] that's what I like about cats
[2016-05-13 00:35:02 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I have a stray bunch of hair which keeps falling down into my face which is annoying me a bit.
[2016-05-13 00:35:15 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] pharpend, I have a kitten napping on my lap at the moment.
[2016-05-13 00:36:02 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] my cat is screaming at me from the other room
[2016-05-13 00:38:38 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] pharpend, what does your cat want?
[2016-05-13 00:38:55 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] I don't know, she's just awful.
[2016-05-13 00:39:32 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] my date and time is correct but I keep getting emails and it says it's 7:00AM instead of 10:00PM
[2016-05-13 00:39:39 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] i'm using thunderbird
[2016-05-13 00:39:45 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] pharpend, well, you might as well go find out what she wants, or she will be unbearable.
[2016-05-13 00:40:17 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena: noise cancelling headphones are my solution
[2016-05-13 00:40:21 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] then you just teach the cat that it gets its way if it's annoying
[2016-05-13 00:40:35 -0500] [pharpend in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught: mhm
[2016-05-13 00:41:20 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, cats always get their way.
[2016-05-13 00:41:32 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] is a slave to her kitten.
[2016-05-13 00:42:11 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I'm slave to no one
[2016-05-13 00:42:16 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't even have a job
[2016-05-13 00:42:22 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] Lady_Aleena, I'm total boyfriend material rite?
[2016-05-13 00:43:02 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] lol i'm so screwed it isn't even funny
[2016-05-13 00:44:48 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] .coffee avis
[2016-05-13 00:44:49 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] brews a tasty, tiny cup of coffee and gives it to avis
[2016-05-13 00:45:13 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] .cookie tortib
[2016-05-13 00:45:15 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] gives tortib a bacon cookie
[2016-05-13 00:45:27 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't think bacon should be anywhere near a cookie
[2016-05-13 00:45:29 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] rotfl.
[2016-05-13 00:45:47 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] wow why did I say don't
[2016-05-13 00:45:52 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] damn I am dumb
[2016-05-13 00:46:12 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] i bet bacon cookies pair well with pork sode
[2016-05-13 00:46:15 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] legion is plotting something
[2016-05-13 00:46:19 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] s/sode/soda
[2016-05-13 00:46:21 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I'm sure it will be bad whatever it is
[2016-05-13 00:46:46 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] I really should get up and take my meds (diabetic).
[2016-05-13 00:47:12 -0500] [Lady_Aleena in #debian-offtopic] brb
[2016-05-13 00:47:14 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] they will more than likely degrade my windows computer
[2016-05-13 00:47:21 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I don't know how or what they will do
[2016-05-13 00:50:02 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] Legion just wants to bring the heretic geths back into the broader geth family
[2016-05-13 00:50:04 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] Buenas ...
[2016-05-13 00:52:04 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] jmcnaught, who are these geths
[2016-05-13 00:52:13 -0500] [Rust3dCor3 in #debian] Hello. Im using stable. I have some issues with few apps. Should I consider moving to testing? Is it stable or the testing word is just there because lack of any other suitable word?
[2016-05-13 00:52:19 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] apparently from a video game?
[2016-05-13 00:52:43 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian-offtopic] tortib: yeah they're like the Cylons of the Mass Effect trilogy
[2016-05-13 00:53:31 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] Rust3dCor3: you could very well end up having more problems on testing since it's not finished yet. What kind of problems are you having?
[2016-05-13 00:54:10 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] time to play Doom
[2016-05-13 00:54:21 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] I hope they fixed the graphics
[2016-05-13 00:54:24 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] !dontbreakdebian
[2016-05-13 00:54:25 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] hmm... dont break debian is https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian

[2016-05-13 00:55:10 -0500] [RoyK in #debian] Rust3dCor3: my advice, if you need something new and fancy, use a vm for it

[2016-05-13 00:55:46 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Shiny New Shit Syndrome is a serious disorder, which usually breaks out into an epidemic every time something new is released.  If you have SNS, ask me about <backports> and <ssb>; these are better options than upgrading to <testing> because it is a <moving target>.

[2016-05-13 03:34:44 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] buenas
[2016-05-13 03:35:49 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] tengo un problema para acceder por ssh
[2016-05-13 03:35:58 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] estoy en wheezy
[2016-05-13 03:36:54 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] el log auth.log me indica:
[2016-05-13 03:38:01 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] pam_unix: autenticacion erronea
[2016-05-13 03:38:07 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] antes podia acceder
[2016-05-13 03:39:06 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] pero hace unos meses cree un nuevo usuario y borre el anterior. Ademas cambie el password de root en el pc donde intento acceder por ssh
[2016-05-13 03:39:59 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] intento acceder como root y como usuario pero en el cliente me pone permiso denegado
[2016-05-13 03:40:22 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] sin embargo, desde el servidor ssh al cliente si puedo acceder por ssh
[2016-05-13 03:41:57 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] mejor dicho, pc1 y pc2 se intenta comunicar por ssh, desde pc1 a pc2 puedo acceder, pero de pc2 a pc1 no puedo
[2016-05-13 03:59:50 -0500] [dka in #debian] I have disabled ipv6 on my public interface, I don't understand how I can still access services through this protocole, the command "more /proc/net/if_inet6" show me that ipv6 is disabled on this interface. the command "netstat -anp | grep :::" show me a few services listening on tcp6, the command "telnet myhost.com 31828" show me  one of them is accessible
[2016-05-13 04:01:20 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] quorum, pinta a que estas usando una autentificacion por sha2
[2016-05-13 04:01:41 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si
[2016-05-13 04:01:44 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y claro, al reiniciar el usuario tambien cambio su sshkey
[2016-05-13 04:01:58 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] y cual es la solucion?
[2016-05-13 04:02:21 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] añade el passkey de tu ssha2 al archivo ~/.ssh/authorized_keys del server
[2016-05-13 04:02:52 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] en la cuenta de usuario en cuestion (lado cliente): ssh-keygen
[2016-05-13 04:03:09 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] eso genera la clave en ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[2016-05-13 04:03:37 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] esa clave es la que tienes que meter en el servidor/ => ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[2016-05-13 04:03:45 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ok voy a probar
[2016-05-13 04:04:40 -0500] [Rephlexie in #debian] how did you disable it?
[2016-05-13 04:04:42 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] la otra opcion es permitir tambien la clave de usuario en el archiuvo sshd_config
[2016-05-13 04:05:16 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] sobre todo por seguridad y no tienes acceso fisico al server y se te pierde el archivo sshkeyfile o cambias de usuario xD
[2016-05-13 04:05:49 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] a parte de RSAAuthentication yes y PubkeyAuthentication yes usa UsePAM yes
[2016-05-13 04:06:36 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] eso estaba ya en sshd_config
[2016-05-13 04:06:49 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] pero la clave de usuario no
[2016-05-13 04:08:12 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] te comento que el archivo authorized_keys no existe en el server
[2016-05-13 04:08:20 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] mmm
[2016-05-13 04:09:05 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] vamos a hacerlo de otra manera, usa el flag -v
[2016-05-13 04:09:27 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] a ve que dice/pasa, eso entra en modo debug el ssh (en el cliente)
[2016-05-13 04:09:27 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] en el cliente?
[2016-05-13 04:09:45 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] si
[2016-05-13 04:09:47 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password <--
[2016-05-13 04:09:53 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] va por orden
[2016-05-13 04:10:03 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y/o cualquier error saldrá ahí
[2016-05-13 04:10:40 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por ejemplo, si solo sale publickey es imperativo crear ~/.ssh/authorized_keys xD
[2016-05-13 04:11:55 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] no veo ningun error
[2016-05-13 04:11:57 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] en cliente
[2016-05-13 04:12:01 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por supuesto que si tienes PermitRootLogin no en el sshd_config NO puedes usar ssh root@lala !
[2016-05-13 04:12:09 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si eso si
[2016-05-13 04:12:11 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] qu lo he obviado eso pero vamos
[2016-05-13 04:12:14 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] en el server lo tengo permitido
[2016-05-13 04:12:18 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:12:27 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] pues no veo errores
[2016-05-13 04:12:33 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] solo permiso denegado
[2016-05-13 04:12:37 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password <-- ?
[2016-05-13 04:12:38 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] que dice
[2016-05-13 04:13:14 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
[2016-05-13 04:13:21 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] vale, usa ambos
[2016-05-13 04:13:51 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] pues la clave o el usuario es invalido no tiene mas mmm
[2016-05-13 04:13:59 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] que va
[2016-05-13 04:14:09 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] tanto la clave root como de usuario son correctas
[2016-05-13 04:14:13 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] puede que el terminal que estes usando para conectar envie saltos de escape o algo raro
[2016-05-13 04:14:19 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] mmm
[2016-05-13 04:14:34 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] voy a probar por tty
[2016-05-13 04:14:59 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ya sabes que es case sensitive
[2016-05-13 04:15:11 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] prueba con otro terminal a ver si
[2016-05-13 04:15:20 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] tampoco
[2016-05-13 04:15:45 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] pues puede ser por permisos en el directorio remoto
[2016-05-13 04:15:53 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] o a saber, opciones de montaje
[2016-05-13 04:16:04 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] antes accedia bien
[2016-05-13 04:16:19 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] en el momento que cambie de usuario y las claves de root ya no pude entrar
[2016-05-13 04:16:29 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] no se ha tocado configuraciones
[2016-05-13 04:16:36 -0500] [uniTosch in #debian-offtopic] Hello gals and girls!

[2016-05-13 04:18:00 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] el caso es que desde el server al cliente si conecta por ssh
[2016-05-13 04:18:01 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por que ademas te lo dice "permiso denegado" no ?
[2016-05-13 04:18:05 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si

[2016-05-13 04:18:11 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] no te dice usuario/password error

[2016-05-13 04:33:08 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ahora acabo de probar en el server y hago ssh sin problemas al cliente
[2016-05-13 04:33:20 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] que raro

[2016-05-13 04:34:57 -0500] [jvava in #debian] hi, i installed gnome-screensaver, but i dont know how to appear a screeanserver to check input password work, please help
[2016-05-13 04:35:00 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] llevo dos dias de locos
[2016-05-13 04:35:15 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] pruebae so quorum
[2016-05-13 04:35:25 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] crea en el servidor el archivo ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[2016-05-13 04:35:41 -0500] [est31 in #debian] Anyone seen Markus Koschany <apo@debian.org> ?
[2016-05-13 04:35:46 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:35:48 -0500] [est31 in #debian] or Martin Quinson <mquinson@debian.org>?
[2016-05-13 04:35:51 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y metes dentro lo que tienes en /root/.ssh/ida_rsa.pub
[2016-05-13 04:35:54 -0500] [est31 in #debian] what are their freenode nicks
[2016-05-13 04:35:59 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] (del cliente)
[2016-05-13 04:36:01 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:36:04 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] voy a probar
[2016-05-13 04:36:09 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] me explico no ?
[2016-05-13 04:36:11 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si
[2016-05-13 04:36:37 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] así de paso no te pedira clave si funciona xD
[2016-05-13 04:36:48 -0500] [jvava in #debian] est31, do you know how to run a screensaver?
[2016-05-13 04:36:53 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] pero tienes que tener 700 en /root/.ssh y en /root
[2016-05-13 04:36:57 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] si no, no rula
[2016-05-13 04:37:07 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] jvava, gnome-screensaver-command -l maybe
[2016-05-13 04:37:20 -0500] [jvava in #debian] i means i cant wait the timeout to enter screensaver
[2016-05-13 04:37:23 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y el archivo /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 600 creo que vale
[2016-05-13 04:37:39 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] una cosa, la instalación de Debian por defecto no permite acceder por ssh como root *con clave compartida*
[2016-05-13 04:37:56 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] dice que lo cambio a permitRootLogin yes
[2016-05-13 04:37:59 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] lo que me parece raro es que no le deje entrar como usuario
[2016-05-13 04:38:06 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] y authorized_keys da igual el permiso que tenga
[2016-05-13 04:38:08 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] lo importante es
[2016-05-13 04:38:10 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] .ssh
[2016-05-13 04:38:13 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] esta permitido, esta en ye
[2016-05-13 04:38:14 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] yes
[2016-05-13 04:38:17 -0500] [jvava in #debian] thank you, cynicallemon, very great!
[2016-05-13 04:38:27 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] no problem
[2016-05-13 04:38:29 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] Heimy, y los permisos de usuario tambien
[2016-05-13 04:38:43 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] si no da permiso denegado si tienes mas permisos
[2016-05-13 04:39:08 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] ls -l ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[2016-05-13 04:39:08 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] -rw-r--r-- 1 javi javi 820 Mar 18  2006 /home/javi/.ssh/authorized_keys
[2016-05-13 04:39:08 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] javi@gjallarhorn:~/share/MangAnime$
[2016-05-13 04:39:10 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] y funciona
[2016-05-13 04:39:12 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] :P
[2016-05-13 04:39:16 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] hablo con conocimiento de causa
[2016-05-13 04:39:21 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] no no, digo /home/user
[2016-05-13 04:39:27 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] ah, eso es otra historia
[2016-05-13 04:39:45 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] yo lo que probe debe tener permisos maximo 700
[2016-05-13 04:39:50 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] .ssh
[2016-05-13 04:39:55 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y ssh tambien
[2016-05-13 04:40:08 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] a ver, el /home da igual
[2016-05-13 04:40:18 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] el /home/usuario, tambié
[2016-05-13 04:40:20 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] n
[2016-05-13 04:40:21 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] bueno, tambien es de sentido comun que el perfil de usuario no tenga 777 xD
[2016-05-13 04:40:24 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] el crítico es ~/.ssh
[2016-05-13 04:40:31 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] hombre, claro
[2016-05-13 04:40:37 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] pero 755 para el $HOME vale
[2016-05-13 04:41:15 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] lo voy a probar
[2016-05-13 04:41:25 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] te lo digo porque es el modo por defecto de Debian
[2016-05-13 04:41:28 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] yo lo tengo así
[2016-05-13 04:42:37 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] efectivamente si
[2016-05-13 04:42:41 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ya tenia mis dudas
[2016-05-13 04:43:16 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] bueno, no tengo debian en el server yo, tengo gentoo
[2016-05-13 04:43:23 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] bueno, a ver como meto la clave en el server sin un pen
[2016-05-13 04:43:39 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] esa es otra
[2016-05-13 04:43:42 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] ¿puedes acceder al servidor de otra manera?
[2016-05-13 04:43:50 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] fisicamente si
[2016-05-13 04:43:52 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:43:54 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] antes dijistes que tenias acceso fisicamente
[2016-05-13 04:43:57 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si
[2016-05-13 04:43:59 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] entonces pone la clave pública en cualqueir sitio
[2016-05-13 04:44:04 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] por ejemplo, te la puedes enviar por correo
[2016-05-13 04:44:07 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] y descargarlo en el servidor
[2016-05-13 04:44:13 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] eso iba a hacer
[2016-05-13 04:44:17 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] cuidado
[2016-05-13 04:44:18 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] o colgarla en alguna web y usar wget
[2016-05-13 04:44:26 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] no pegues la privada, ojo :P
[2016-05-13 04:44:28 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] sólo la pública
[2016-05-13 04:44:31 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] si si
[2016-05-13 04:44:46 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] en pastebin.com
[2016-05-13 04:44:49 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] good morning
[2016-05-13 04:45:04 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y copias el paste en raw

[2016-05-13 04:45:34 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] thanks, i can use that :)
[2016-05-13 04:46:18 -0500] [CyberJacob in #debian] Am I right in thinking that rtl8192cu is the right module for an RTL8188CU chipset using USB?
[2016-05-13 04:47:43 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] CyberJacob, i think so but that chipset is rather naff IMHO
[2016-05-13 04:47:57 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por cierto, si ejecutas ssh-agent en el cliente que te dice quorum ?
[2016-05-13 04:48:14 -0500] [CyberJacob in #debian] cynicallemon: yeah, got sent the wrong ones, trying to see if I can do monitor mode on them
[2016-05-13 04:48:51 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] bueno, me dispongo a probar
[2016-05-13 04:48:54 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:49:00 -0500] [anao2 in #debian] Question@ALL How to set auto-"N" on apt-get dist-upgrade for "config-files"
[2016-05-13 04:49:03 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] deberia entrar directo sin pedirte clave
[2016-05-13 04:49:18 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] no me deja
[2016-05-13 04:49:26 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ejecuta ssh-agent
[2016-05-13 04:49:29 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] bueno
[2016-05-13 04:49:37 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] tendre q reiniciar ssh
[2016-05-13 04:49:39 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] mmm
[2016-05-13 04:49:43 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] espera
[2016-05-13 04:49:44 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] también
[2016-05-13 04:50:09 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] a ver si va a ser por que la clave esta "poco ofuscada"
[2016-05-13 04:50:15 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] nada
[2016-05-13 04:50:18 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y Debian te la esta descartando jajajajajajaajajaja
[2016-05-13 04:50:19 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] n ose
[2016-05-13 04:50:23 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] y encima me pide clave
[2016-05-13 04:50:26 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] CyberJacob, you should be able to get the latest from realtek website anyway
[2016-05-13 04:50:37 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] si ejecuta el ssh-agent tiene que añadir la clave primero
[2016-05-13 04:50:39 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] claro, si falla el pubkey va a por el metodo password
[2016-05-13 04:50:47 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] (ssh-add)
[2016-05-13 04:50:56 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ya lo hizo Heimy
[2016-05-13 04:51:00 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por eso se lo digo
[2016-05-13 04:51:05 -0500] [CyberJacob in #debian] cynicallemon: any idea if it supports monitor mode?
[2016-05-13 04:51:11 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ahh no, perdon
[2016-05-13 04:51:19 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] no sorry
[2016-05-13 04:51:24 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] pero es raro todo esto
[2016-05-13 04:51:30 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] hizo el ssh-keygen nada mas
[2016-05-13 04:51:32 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] joe
[2016-05-13 04:51:37 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] quorum: una cosa que puedes hacer es ejecutar el servidor manualmente en el servidor
[2016-05-13 04:51:45 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] quorum: en modo debug, para que te diga todo lo que está haciendo
[2016-05-13 04:51:54 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] quorum: de esa manera sabrás por qué falla
[2016-05-13 04:51:56 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] voy a probar
[2016-05-13 04:52:02 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] con -d era no?
[2016-05-13 04:52:10 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] yep
[2016-05-13 04:52:12 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] para primero el servidor
[2016-05-13 04:52:15 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] y luego -d
[2016-05-13 04:52:17 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ok
[2016-05-13 04:52:18 -0500] [cynicallemon in #debian] is monitor mode for sniffing wireless packets?
[2016-05-13 04:52:22 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] puedes hacer -d, -dd, o -ddd
[2016-05-13 04:52:29 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] incrementando el nivel
[2016-05-13 04:52:39 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] voy por -d primero a ver que dice
[2016-05-13 04:53:23 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] muchas cosas
[2016-05-13 04:56:12 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] usando eso descubrí en su día lo de los permisos necesarios :D
[2016-05-13 04:56:20 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] es una tontería, pero...
[2016-05-13 04:56:48 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian] anao2, within apt-get there is an option (default behavior) to keep the old config files -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold"
[2016-05-13 04:57:46 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian] anao2, mostly used on automated updates even within dist-upgrading. If this is really usefull has to be seen.
[2016-05-13 04:58:35 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] el manual creo que lo dice eso
[2016-05-13 04:59:13 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] pues, te puedes volver loco con el pubkey si no xD
[2016-05-13 04:59:37 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por que ahí creo recordar lo mismo, permiso denegado
[2016-05-13 04:59:41 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] ya, claro
[2016-05-13 04:59:50 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] pero asumamos que no leí el manual :D
[2016-05-13 05:00:01 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian] anao2, regular backups needed anyway ;)
[2016-05-13 05:00:12 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] nah, si tienes los permisos mal, no usa la clave
[2016-05-13 05:00:32 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] ya
[2016-05-13 05:00:44 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] el "permiso denegado" significa que la clave compartida que estás tecleando no coincide
[2016-05-13 05:00:49 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] quorum, a que salen muchas cosas ahi ? xD
[2016-05-13 05:00:52 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] o que no te deja entrar por alguna razón
[2016-05-13 05:00:57 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] pero nada que ver con la clave pública
[2016-05-13 05:01:11 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y si es por permisos creo que tambie te lo dice lo de permiso denegado
[2016-05-13 05:01:21 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] bueno
[2016-05-13 05:01:22 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y sale entre parentesis pubkey

[2016-05-13 05:07:31 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] si tienes AllowUsers, eso va a ser el problema
[2016-05-13 05:07:35 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] xD

[2016-05-13 05:08:07 -0500] [Heimy in #debian-es] Ahí da igual lo demás, si no tienes los usuarios en AllowUsers, no podrás entrar con ellos
[2016-05-13 05:08:09 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] uniTosch_, see, your live is ruled by places and automation. No such thing as free will ;)
[2016-05-13 05:08:39 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] por defecto ?
[2016-05-13 05:08:40 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] exacto Heimy
[2016-05-13 05:08:46 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] Gerritjan: user needs to be allowed to use sudo as defined in /etc/sudoers. A common (and default) setup is that members of the sudo group can run all commands, so adding the user to that group will do it. This requires you to log in as root first
[2016-05-13 05:08:48 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] no se como pude ponerlo en sshd
[2016-05-13 05:08:53 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] no recuerdo, si no les añades no los permitia ?
[2016-05-13 05:09:00 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] ni siquiera me dio por verlo en el server
[2016-05-13 05:09:09 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] es que solo era eso o que tengas alguna regla en /etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny
[2016-05-13 05:09:14 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] lo he comentado la linea y me deja entrar

[2016-05-13 05:09:35 -0500] [Gerritjan in #debian] thats the problem
[2016-05-13 05:09:42 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] you set a root password on install

[2016-05-13 05:09:55 -0500] [psylence in #debian] Gerritjan, does 'su -' work?
[2016-05-13 05:09:56 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] y caí en ello
[2016-05-13 05:10:00 -0500] [psylence in #debian] bezaban beat me to it

[2016-05-13 05:10:18 -0500] [Gerritjan in #debian] and now i can with visudo add it?
[2016-05-13 05:10:21 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] jamas se me olvidara

[2016-05-13 05:10:52 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] Nono, i'm a free Individual.
[2016-05-13 05:10:54 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] if you want to use the sudo group you add user to group. I usually edit /etc/group, but there is a command for it too
[2016-05-13 05:10:55 -0500] [Gerritjan in #debian] so like gerrit ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
[2016-05-13 05:11:06 -0500] [dutchfish in #debian-offtopic] :)
[2016-05-13 05:11:13 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] takes a sip from his Coca Cola bottle
[2016-05-13 05:11:21 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] or you can add the user with visudo directly to the sudoers file
[2016-05-13 05:11:37 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] that looks pretty right
[2016-05-13 05:11:52 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] Noone can tell me what to do!
[2016-05-13 05:11:58 -0500] [Gerritjan in #debian] but do i need to reboot or?
[2016-05-13 05:12:00 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] very right actually :)
[2016-05-13 05:12:01 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] bites into his kitkat

[2016-05-13 05:13:08 -0500] [bezaban in #debian] that helps ;)
[2016-05-13 05:13:59 -0500] [Gerritjan in #debian] well i hope i dont have any problem along the way before i can program in debian and setup the RPI
[2016-05-13 05:14:22 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] Man, this theoretical CS stuff is melting my brain.

[2016-05-13 05:29:34 -0500] [lugonzaro in #debian-es] es una distro para gente "mas avanzada", y sobre todo con ganas de aprender
[2016-05-13 05:30:53 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] entonces es mi distro

[2016-05-13 05:31:28 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] por eso no he actualizado
[2016-05-13 05:31:44 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] gentoo usa el init openrc?

[2016-05-13 05:33:32 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] voy a probarlo en breve
[2016-05-13 05:33:34 -0500] [quorum in #debian-es] gentoo

[2016-05-13 06:16:49 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] What kind of microphone is it?
[2016-05-13 06:17:02 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] `sudo journalctl -a` might also help.
[2016-05-13 06:17:04 -0500] [shingouz in #debian] nothing showing there of any consequence. just something plugged into the sound card input

[2016-05-13 06:20:37 -0500] [shingouz in #debian] looks like i either have to reboot and reread dmesg or remove/insert the sound modules. the uptime on this one is too high for any relevant information to sit in any acessible place. well... off to modprobing then

[2016-05-13 06:29:47 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] shingouz: You have to look into ALSA and PulseAudio.
[2016-05-13 06:29:59 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] shingouz: If it is no USB, you won’t see it under `/dev`.
[2016-05-13 06:30:17 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] shingouz: There is a alsa-info.sh script or so from the ALSA project, which might give you valuable information.
[2016-05-13 06:31:32 -0500] [uniTosch_ in #debian-offtopic] CutMeOwnThroat: did you hear? Pool party at dutchies place!
[2016-05-13 06:32:27 -0500] [shingouz in #debian] ahh... thanks PaulePanter. looks like this takes a little more work than i am prepared to do at this exact moment, i have to hack it later today. there are other more important things to do, laundry for instance :)
[2016-05-13 06:35:14 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] shingouz: No problem. I know the feeling.
[2016-05-13 06:43:15 -0500] [harmonious in #debian] oh hi
[2016-05-13 06:43:43 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] can i install debian without also installing a WM
[2016-05-13 06:44:05 -0500] [Johann in #debian] Quatroking: sure
[2016-05-13 06:44:11 -0500] [harmonious in #debian] does anyone happen to know how to move this stupid thing?
[2016-05-13 06:44:14 -0500] [harmonious in #debian] http://imgur.com/qdCqms7
[2016-05-13 06:44:17 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] is this an option during setup or something?
[2016-05-13 06:44:21 -0500] [harmonious in #debian] just upgraded kali and hate the desktop
[2016-05-13 06:44:27 -0500] [Johann in #debian] the normal installer ask you what "group" of package you want
[2016-05-13 06:44:32 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] oh neat
[2016-05-13 06:44:34 -0500] [Johann in #debian] you can avoid choosing a wm there
[2016-05-13 06:44:52 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I plan on re-using an old thinclient as a basic MAME machine
[2016-05-13 06:44:55 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] just a small project
[2016-05-13 06:45:56 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] trying out the setup in vmware first
[2016-05-13 06:48:20 -0500] [Johann in #debian] Quatroking: just avoid installing the "desktop environment" set of packages and you should be fine
[2016-05-13 06:48:55 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Alright
[2016-05-13 06:49:27 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] will this still allow me to run GUI applications somehow?
[2016-05-13 06:50:06 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I mean I can run gparted through x11 forwarding over SSH, does this work local too?
[2016-05-13 06:50:24 -0500] [Johann in #debian] no, you need to have an x11 server at least
[2016-05-13 06:50:35 -0500] [Johann in #debian] and, most probably, a window manager too
[2016-05-13 06:50:41 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I see
[2016-05-13 06:51:48 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] harmonious: Look for an extension for GNOME doing that. By default it’s not possible to my knowledge.
[2016-05-13 06:52:00 -0500] [Johann in #debian] but as you said you can use x11 forwarding if you need gui app but don't want a wm
[2016-05-13 06:52:00 -0500] [PaulePanter in #debian] harmonious: But I guess there are enough answers in the Internet.
[2016-05-13 06:53:08 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Johann, oh right, because I have X11 running on my SSH client
[2016-05-13 06:53:15 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yeah that makes sense
[2016-05-13 06:53:23 -0500] [Johann in #debian] Quatroking: still if you try to minimize your install you should try to administrate your server without gui app
[2016-05-13 06:53:46 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] oh yeah I can do pretty much everything through SSH without a problem
[2016-05-13 06:54:06 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] it's just that stuff like gparted is just so easy
[2016-05-13 06:54:22 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] also, just-in-case scenario
[2016-05-13 06:54:42 -0500] [Johann in #debian] fdisk is too when you get used to it :)
[2016-05-13 06:55:40 -0500] [sexytime in #debian] what is the latest debian linux kernel?
[2016-05-13 06:58:19 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] hrm. have styles broken for anyone else? for me all but Adwaita and High Contrast are borked. I lose slider controls (or they're invisible)
[2016-05-13 06:58:26 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] ,kernels
[2016-05-13 06:58:28 -0500] [judd in #debian] Available kernel versions are: experimental: 4.6.0-rc7-686-pae (4.6~rc7-1~exp1); sid: 4.5.0-2-686-pae (4.5.3-2); stretch: 4.5.0-2-686-pae (4.5.3-2); jessie-backports: 4.5.0-0.bpo.1-686 (4.5.1-1~bpo8+1); jessie: 3.16.0-4-686-pae (3.16.7-ckt25-1); wheezy-backports: 3.16.0-0.bpo.4-686-pae (3.16.7-ckt25-2~bpo70+1); wheezy: 3.2.0-4-686-pae (3.2.78-1)
[2016-05-13 06:58:30 -0500] [aypea[1] in #debian] using sarge.
[2016-05-13 06:58:37 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] sexytime: ^^
[2016-05-13 06:58:50 -0500] [sexytime in #debian] ah i see
[2016-05-13 06:58:57 -0500] [sexytime in #debian] ty zykotick9
[2016-05-13 07:02:58 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I don't suppose debian can be installed over ssh or something so that I won't need a monitor and an extra keyboard for installation?
[2016-05-13 07:03:12 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] I can't access nfs partition "/media/dn3_" and when I'm trying to unmount it, it says "umount.nfs: /media/dn3_: Stale NFS file handle", how to fix it ?
[2016-05-13 07:03:36 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I mean sure I have a spare monitor but if I could just do it on my main desktop that'd be great
[2016-05-13 07:15:46 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] JustinHitla: umount -f should fix it.... stale is server generated...
[2016-05-13 07:20:30 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] hasn't historically had much luck "umount -f"ing stale NFS mounts...
[2016-05-13 07:21:09 -0500] [dka in #debian] Is there a way to completely disable ipv6 for everything ? (even docker)
[2016-05-13 07:21:12 -0500] [dka in #debian] Is there a way to completely disable ipv6 for everything ? (even docker)
[2016-05-13 07:22:06 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] dka: why?
[2016-05-13 07:22:34 -0500] [Rephlexie in #debian] dka, do it via grub
[2016-05-13 07:23:46 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] dka: disabling ipv6 for everything looks like !xy also is not recommended at all
[2016-05-13 07:26:39 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] ChrisH: "-f" not working either
[2016-05-13 07:26:48 -0500] [lss9 in #debian] what exactly is this 'pristine-tar' tool? I've not found a good explanation so far
[2016-05-13 07:32:51 -0500] [fred1807 in #debian] does wicd-curses save changes to the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf  file?
[2016-05-13 07:32:57 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] lss9: if two people take the same set of files and tar them up on their own systems, they generally won't get identical .tar files
[2016-05-13 07:33:43 -0500] [lss9 in #debian] why?
[2016-05-13 07:34:22 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] different versions of tar produce slightly different files
[2016-05-13 07:34:34 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] even with the same version, there might be things like user ids different
[2016-05-13 07:34:55 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] or an archive creation timestamp or something (I don't know much about the tar format)
[2016-05-13 07:35:59 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] pristine-tar lets the second person generate the same .tar file as the first person, by giving them a small delta file that contains all of the bits of the tar archive other than the files themselves
[2016-05-13 07:38:31 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] why would someone use pristine-tar ?
[2016-05-13 07:39:04 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] also you can always do diff on "tar -l" output of both archives
[2016-05-13 07:39:11 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] and find out the differences
[2016-05-13 07:41:28 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] buenas muyayos :-)
[2016-05-13 07:42:24 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] it makes it easier for people to get the exact original tarball for a specific release of a software project, without needing to keep a giant archive of all tarballs ever released for the project sitting around
[2016-05-13 07:42:40 -0500] [Dagger in #debian] (the delta file is small enough to go into source control)
[2016-05-13 07:47:12 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] its strange, I have stallen NFS link in /media/dn3_ and I can't go into it but I can open files inside that directory using links to files, if I do "cd /media/dn3_" it says "bash: cd: /media/dn3_: Stale NFS file handle" but if I do "cd /media/dn3_/_3/_9" it changes to that directory, why is that ?
[2016-05-13 07:48:22 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] and if I in "/media/dn3_/_3" and I do "cd .." I can't it says "bash: cd: ..: Stale NFS file handle"
[2016-05-13 07:56:19 -0500] [lss9 in #debian] so I created my first C project and want to package it for debian. i didn't find a good tutorial for beginners on how to do so. any recommendations?
[2016-05-13 07:56:43 -0500] [lss9 in #debian] the "official" docs are really hard to understand
[2016-05-13 07:56:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] the new maintainer's guide?
[2016-05-13 07:57:18 -0500] [lss9 in #debian] yup
[2016-05-13 07:58:18 -0500] [p3rL in #debian] hello
[2016-05-13 07:58:20 -0500] [p3rL in #debian] i need help
[2016-05-13 07:59:03 -0500] [p3rL in #debian] looking for help
[2016-05-13 07:59:06 -0500] [p3rL in #debian] any one ???
[2016-05-13 08:11:19 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] How do i reload /etc/aliases after editing?
[2016-05-13 08:17:09 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Shiny happy people everywhere!
[2016-05-13 08:19:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] holding hands and dancing?
[2016-05-13 08:22:40 -0500] [jelly in #debian] afernandez_: depends on the MTA you use, sendmail and postfix have the "newaliases" command
[2016-05-13 08:25:29 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] jelly: We ought to be realistic: This is Germany after all and dancing is not a German virtue
[2016-05-13 08:25:42 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] OK Thanks jelly
[2016-05-13 08:25:42 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Shiny and happy is already more than I asked for
[2016-05-13 08:25:47 -0500] [frangor in #debian-es-offtopic] nas
[2016-05-13 08:26:13 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] I have several files and i have to search and replace the same thing in all how do i do that with vim? or vi?
[2016-05-13 08:26:21 -0500] [ChrisH in #debian] JustinHitla: what NFS Server? automounter involved?
[2016-05-13 08:26:51 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] no automounter
[2016-05-13 08:26:52 -0500] [dn in #debian] I'm trying to add a few rules to iptables at the same time as starting openvpn daemon with "/etc/init.d/openvpn start", but it doesn't seem to work. No rules gets added to iptables. Running apply-rules.sh from shell works fine (file just contains a bunch of iptable commands). What am I doing wrong? init script is here (shaved down a bit): http://pastie.org/private/rpt4taevcdt6mzd97cbjg#
[2016-05-13 08:27:05 -0500] [greycat in #debian] afernandez_: in a single file, if you're already in vi, you can do ESC :%s/old stuff/new stuff/g ENTER
[2016-05-13 08:27:53 -0500] [greycat in #debian] where old stuff uses some flavor of regular expression syntax
[2016-05-13 08:28:18 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] greycat: i can do it in one file but how do i do the same change in 100 files?
[2016-05-13 08:28:24 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Actually, I have no idea how Mick Jagger could mention Germany in his song "Dancing in the streets"
[2016-05-13 08:28:29 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Then I wouldn't use vi at all.  I'd use perl.
[2016-05-13 08:28:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] perl -pi -e 's/foo/bar/g' *mask*
[2016-05-13 08:28:53 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] perl? uhhh I do not know perl...
[2016-05-13 08:28:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Now you do.
[2016-05-13 08:29:02 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] mask is for what?
[2016-05-13 08:29:11 -0500] [themill in #debian] or sed
[2016-05-13 08:29:11 -0500] [greycat in #debian] *.txt or whatever to specify the files to edit
[2016-05-13 08:29:26 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] oh ok
[2016-05-13 08:29:27 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] cool
[2016-05-13 08:29:39 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] themill: and your sed command?
[2016-05-13 08:30:09 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] let say i have files abc abd and abf  and i need to s foo for bar
[2016-05-13 08:30:23 -0500] [themill in #debian] sed -i s/foo/bar/ files
[2016-05-13 08:30:39 -0500] [greycat in #debian] s/foo/bar/g to do all occurrences in a line
[2016-05-13 08:30:53 -0500] [greycat in #debian] otherwise, it only does the first occurrence in each line
[2016-05-13 08:32:24 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] wow miren la grafica que genero esta cosa despues de 24hrs y 161673 bytes capturados https://ptpb.pw/BL0-.png
[2016-05-13 08:32:32 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thank you all
[2016-05-13 08:32:41 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] of course i have to backup the files first
[2016-05-13 08:32:47 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] can i do like a for loop?
[2016-05-13 08:32:55 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Sure.
[2016-05-13 08:33:10 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Ok thanks guys....
[2016-05-13 08:33:58 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] osea que lo mas comun dicho fue "el debian" hehe, claro eran solo canales de debian xD
[2016-05-13 08:35:31 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] what if I just remove "stale NFS file handle" ?
[2016-05-13 08:35:41 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] I have this flash drive on which I have created a gpt file system with /boot as a primary partition, and then an lvm partition... these partitions I have mounted and unpacked a debian system unto.

[2016-05-13 08:35:59 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] I believe that something is wrong with my usage of LVM
[2016-05-13 08:36:17 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] Anybody has any ideas?

[2016-05-13 08:40:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] now an embedded system. right.
[2016-05-13 08:40:38 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Nothing he's said so far has been self-contradictory or unreasonable.

[2016-05-13 08:41:06 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] i realized i had /dev/sdb2 for /boot in my fstab, i changed it to sda2, but same result

[2016-05-13 08:41:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] for people using upgrades that makes sense.
[2016-05-13 08:41:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] he's not performing an upgrade

[2016-05-13 08:41:54 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] digresses
[2016-05-13 08:42:03 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] look, this is for an embedded control system
[2016-05-13 08:42:15 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] i cant just update whenever a new stable comes along
[2016-05-13 08:42:37 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] i DO run deb8 on my desktop if that makes you feel better jml2
[2016-05-13 08:43:30 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] but to be on point, anybody has any ideas why I can't find my lvm partitions after grub?
[2016-05-13 08:44:43 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Anyone know of a good tutorial on how to enable postfix and sasl/ anti-spam?
[2016-05-13 08:44:56 -0500] [markybob in #debian] i think greycat's idea was good 08:38 < greycat> #debian-boot on OFTC may have smarter people on this topic
[2016-05-13 08:45:07 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] lo mismo pero con usuarios https://ptpb.pw/ZUAe.png
[2016-05-13 08:45:36 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Either that, or wait an hour or two and ask again, and maybe someone who knows initramfs stuff better will come along.
[2016-05-13 08:45:46 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] okay, i'll head over there
[2016-05-13 08:46:04 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] and it's completely empty lol
[2016-05-13 08:46:29 -0500] [themill in #debian] sh00p: wrong network
[2016-05-13 08:47:55 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] What's a recommended source for Debian 8 tutorials?
[2016-05-13 08:48:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] NoCode, i don't think there are any unfortunately
[2016-05-13 08:48:21 -0500] [greycat in #debian] !handbook
[2016-05-13 08:48:21 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] The Debian Administrator's Handbook is at http://debian-handbook.info/ and can be browsed, bought and downloaded.  From Debian 7 "Wheezy" onwards, it can also can be installed from the debian-handbook package.  Also ask me about <books> <docs>.
[2016-05-13 08:48:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] NoCode, there's the debian-handbook.info
[2016-05-13 08:48:37 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] NoCode, but imho tries to cut too much corners
[2016-05-13 08:48:51 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] NoCode, so there's also the debian wiki which is also helpful
[2016-05-13 08:49:24 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] ok
[2016-05-13 08:49:27 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] NoCode, if you're interested on other sources outside debian i can share them
[2016-05-13 08:49:53 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] sorry one more question the string i need to change is foo for bar in foo@email.com so i hqve to do sed -i.bak s/^foo$/bar/g  ?
[2016-05-13 08:50:09 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Or narrow the question down a bit.  If you're interested in a specific subject, we may be able to give more targeted answers.
[2016-05-13 08:50:36 -0500] [greycat in #debian] afernandez_: ^foo$ will only match whole lines where the entire line is "foo", nothing else.
[2016-05-13 08:50:45 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Well, I have a debian server installed. I'm just looking for a nice tutorial/ nice way to get postfix running securely, and with antispam so my VPS doesn't complain, or I get banned from their services
[2016-05-13 08:51:05 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] ok greycat  just want to replace foo for bar
[2016-05-13 08:51:14 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] leave the rest of the line untouched
[2016-05-13 08:51:18 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Then don't use the anchors ^ and $
[2016-05-13 08:51:24 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] ok
[2016-05-13 08:51:26 -0500] [afernandez_ in #debian] Thanks
[2016-05-13 08:55:13 -0500] [dn in #debian] If I need to execute a bash script when starting a daemon with /etc/init.d/openvpn start, will it suffice to just add the path to the script right after the "start-stop-daemon" line in the init script?
[2016-05-13 08:55:30 -0500] [greycat in #debian] dn: what version of Debian?
[2016-05-13 08:57:34 -0500] [tout in #debian-es-offtopic] buenas
[2016-05-13 08:58:12 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] hi
[2016-05-13 08:58:17 -0500] [dn in #debian] greycat: 8
[2016-05-13 08:58:21 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] for those interested, turns out i didn't have lvm2 installed
[2016-05-13 08:58:28 -0500] [sh00p in #debian] thanks anyways
[2016-05-13 08:58:33 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Then there ought to be a systemd service you can edit instead of a legacy init.d script.
[2016-05-13 08:58:38 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i'm for holding hands and dancing :3
[2016-05-13 08:59:07 -0500] [dn in #debian] greycat: oh alright, could that be the reason it doesn't work?
[2016-05-13 08:59:25 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] i need a dedicated server and i need a web server on it, i have to choose an OS for it? I can install Debian (32/64), Debian LAMP, Ubuntu workstation, Ubuntu server, CentOS, which one would you choose?
[2016-05-13 08:59:51 -0500] [greycat in #debian] https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/openvpn/filelist  -- yes, there is a systemd unit file
[2016-05-13 09:00:29 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You should probably create /etc/systemd/system/openvpn.service with lines to override the parts of /lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service
[2016-05-13 09:00:32 -0500] [greycat in #debian] that you want to override.
[2016-05-13 09:00:40 -0500] [greycat in #debian] glares at Google-Chrome
[2016-05-13 09:01:25 -0500] [eschmidbauer in #debian] hi. how do i get a library packaged and pushed into debian stable repo?
[2016-05-13 09:01:39 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Where do you dance?
[2016-05-13 09:01:43 -0500] [eschmidbauer in #debian] it's very small, lightweight lib -- https://github.com/mreiferson/libevbuffsock
[2016-05-13 09:01:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] New packages are not going to be added to stable.  That's what stable means.
[2016-05-13 09:02:03 -0500] [eschmidbauer in #debian] ok, how do they eventually get to stable? What is process
[2016-05-13 09:02:03 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] in my room, when noone is watching.
[2016-05-13 09:02:14 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] that's not the streets
[2016-05-13 09:02:26 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] You have been assimilated
[2016-05-13 09:02:37 -0500] [greycat in #debian] They're uploaded to unstable, then they migrate into testing if they meet certain criteria, and then into a future stable release if they meet even more criteria.
[2016-05-13 09:03:19 -0500] [eschmidbauer in #debian] so we need to package it and submit it to unstable?
[2016-05-13 09:05:05 -0500] [dn in #debian] greycat: so if I create a file in /etc/ststemd/system/ it will be run when starting the service?
[2016-05-13 09:06:03 -0500] [greycat in #debian] It will act as local overrides for the corresponding lines of the /lib version of the file.
[2016-05-13 09:06:14 -0500] [dn in #debian] Ah
[2016-05-13 09:07:26 -0500] [dn in #debian] and it doesn't matter that /lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service is only a systemd target? it doesn't need to be a init script?
[2016-05-13 09:12:11 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] where does the log for isc-dhcpd go on wheezy?
[2016-05-13 09:19:48 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] Hi guys. Question: Does exist any way to add delay to the disc writting to certain partition?? I don't wanna add delay to the full drive.
[2016-05-13 09:21:14 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] which is the better version of debian 7 or 8? If i'm used to ubuntu command line
[2016-05-13 09:21:37 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] https://youtu.be/qOyF4hR5GoE
[2016-05-13 09:21:38 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Use the latest stable version (8) unless you have a specific need for an older release.

[2016-05-13 09:26:37 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] greycat , someone told me there are difference between commands, he said ifconfig command is not working on debian 8
[2016-05-13 09:27:01 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] do you know if 1GB of RAM is enough for a web server?
[2016-05-13 09:27:59 -0500] [greycat in #debian] (1) ifconfig is still present, and is still deprecated, just like it has been for a decade.  (2) I run a web server on a VPS node with 384 MB of RAM, no swap.
[2016-05-13 09:28:14 -0500] [markybob in #debian] x-fak: whoever told you that was too stupid to use the full path to ifconfig (/sbin/ifconfig)
[2016-05-13 09:28:23 -0500] [greycat in #debian] It depends on what else the web server has to do besides cough up static files.
[2016-05-13 09:28:30 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] why ifconfig is deprecated ?
[2016-05-13 09:28:50 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] greycat , ok ty, i can get a VPS with 1GB RAM 1Vcore 20GB SSD for 2$/month, is it enough?
[2016-05-13 09:29:06 -0500] [greycat in #debian] !iproute
[2016-05-13 09:29:07 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] it has been said that iproute is the successor to ifconfig and route and allows proper aliasing of ips rather than the old 'ip aliasing' scheme - read http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/2.4routing-3.html, or a more graceful handler for <ipv6>
[2016-05-13 09:29:35 -0500] [greycat in #debian] dpkg, iproute =~ s/html,/html/
[2016-05-13 09:29:36 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] OK, greycat
[2016-05-13 09:30:15 -0500] [greycat in #debian] x-fak: enough for what?  What does it have to do besides serve up static files?
[2016-05-13 09:31:01 -0500] [nadersith in #debian-es] buenas tardes, compañeros
[2016-05-13 09:31:14 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] good afternoon, partners
[2016-05-13 09:31:49 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] how do i mount a cdrom?
[2016-05-13 09:32:56 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] horrors
[2016-05-13 09:33:01 -0500] [mutante in #debian] mount /dev/cdrom ?
[2016-05-13 09:33:04 -0500] [JustinHitla in #debian] mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdroom
[2016-05-13 09:33:21 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+mount+cdrom+in+debian
[2016-05-13 09:33:26 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Or simply "mount /media/cdrom" since that line is in fstab by default.
[2016-05-13 09:33:37 -0500] [greycat in #debian] err. crap.
[2016-05-13 09:33:49 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Or simply "mount /media/cdrom0" since that line is in fstab by default.
[2016-05-13 09:34:01 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] Hi guys. Question: Does exist any way to add delay to the disc writting to certain partition?? I don't wanna add delay to the full drive.
[2016-05-13 09:34:06 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I do have a /media/cdrom0 folder but it's empty
[2016-05-13 09:34:14 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Quatroking: good.
[2016-05-13 09:34:24 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Quatroking: did "mount /media/cdrom0" work as root?
[2016-05-13 09:34:40 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] well I ran into a different problem, I don't seem to have sudo
[2016-05-13 09:34:54 -0500] [greycat in #debian] install it.  it's not a default package.
[2016-05-13 09:34:58 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] oh
[2016-05-13 09:35:14 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I must've installed that on my main debian ages ago then
[2016-05-13 09:35:27 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] su, then apt-get install sudo
[2016-05-13 09:35:36 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] and edit sudoers with visudo command
[2016-05-13 09:36:10 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] oh what the hell apt-get is now asking for the install disk
[2016-05-13 09:36:31 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] is it connected to the Internet?
[2016-05-13 09:36:33 -0500] [greycat in #debian] comment out the CDROM lines in your sources.list and rerun apt-get update
[2016-05-13 09:36:36 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, you cant if you used the usb stick
[2016-05-13 09:36:37 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] it should be
[2016-05-13 09:36:48 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] do as greycat says
[2016-05-13 09:36:58 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, want a quick fix?
[2016-05-13 09:37:05 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] <greycat> x-fak: enough for what?  What does it have to do besides serve up static files? <-installing PHPMyADMIN, maybe something like webmin, using a database and wordpress
[2016-05-13 09:37:12 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] remind me where sources.list is again?
[2016-05-13 09:37:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, maybe i'll try my luck with you.. there was an earlier clown some time ago tehehe
[2016-05-13 09:37:22 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] jml2, sure I guess
[2016-05-13 09:37:35 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, but you have to promise me you'll do what i quote :)
[2016-05-13 09:37:39 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] Quatroking: /etc/apt/sources.list
[2016-05-13 09:37:43 -0500] [greycat in #debian] x-fak: It's not for you?  You're setting this up for other people?
[2016-05-13 09:37:47 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] nadersith, thanks
[2016-05-13 09:37:49 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] jml2, sure
[2016-05-13 09:37:50 -0500] [nadersith in #debian] Quatroking: edit it as root
[2016-05-13 09:37:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, cp /usr/share/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list
[2016-05-13 09:37:55 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, apt-get update
[2016-05-13 09:38:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, apt-get install netselect-apt
[2016-05-13 09:38:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, tell me when you do those 3
[2016-05-13 09:38:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, then we can fine-tune the sources.list for a closer mirror
[2016-05-13 09:38:26 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Don't have na examples folder there
[2016-05-13 09:38:28 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] an*
[2016-05-13 09:38:31 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] greycat , it's for me
[2016-05-13 09:38:35 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jml2: at least give him the proper path
[2016-05-13 09:38:37 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, sry that's ->
[2016-05-13 09:38:44 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, /usr/share/doc/apt/<> ..
[2016-05-13 09:38:54 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Then you don't want all that crap.  webmin is evil and should never be used, ever.  You don't need a control panel or anything like that.
[2016-05-13 09:39:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] people still using webmin?
[2016-05-13 09:39:09 -0500] [greycat in #debian] !webmin
[2016-05-13 09:39:09 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] Webmin is a lame web-based interface for unsafe system administration for Unix.  Check it out at http://webmin.com/  Remember, dondelelcaro *hates* webmin.  "i'd rather sit on the floor shoving table knives into live electrical outlets than run webmin on an exposed server."  Removed from Debian post-Sarge, see http://bugs.debian.org/343897 .  The Debian package from webmin.com is of poor quality.  See <free whcp> for alternatives.
[2016-05-13 09:39:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] there's so many things way better
[2016-05-13 09:39:25 -0500] [mutante in #debian] like "plesk" ,lol, kidding
[2016-05-13 09:40:09 -0500] [greycat in #debian] But to answer your actual question, yes, 1 GB of RAM should be more than enough to run a web server with PHP and wordpress.
[2016-05-13 09:40:13 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, btw, do it as "root" (su -l<enter>)
[2016-05-13 09:40:27 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yeah I was in root
[2016-05-13 09:40:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, so, everything passed?
[2016-05-13 09:40:40 -0500] [jelly in #debian] mutante: plesk is actually really nice to give to a bunch of less qualified admins to manage
[2016-05-13 09:40:48 -0500] [mutante in #debian] oh god, looks like webmin now has "cloudmin"
[2016-05-13 09:40:51 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yeah, it downloaded sudo
[2016-05-13 09:40:52 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] thanks
[2016-05-13 09:41:11 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, you done?
[2016-05-13 09:41:15 -0500] [mutante in #debian] jelly: lol, no. it was once part of my job to support people who use plesk.. never ever again
[2016-05-13 09:41:18 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, you don't want to fine tune that sources.list?
[2016-05-13 09:41:20 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yup
[2016-05-13 09:41:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] Quatroking, ok
[2016-05-13 09:41:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] :)
[2016-05-13 09:41:52 -0500] [jelly in #debian] mutante: that just means you grew above that pay grade
[2016-05-13 09:42:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dealing with end users != managing a system
[2016-05-13 09:42:16 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] the thing with the prutty gal and the lizard happens to me all the time
[2016-05-13 09:42:21 -0500] [mutante in #debian] jelly: no, it means plesk is shit and their business support does too
[2016-05-13 09:42:58 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that's a normal reaction, don't worry.
[2016-05-13 09:43:57 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] damn them attractive lizards!
[2016-05-13 09:44:28 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] make that "those"
[2016-05-13 09:44:50 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] I shouldn't put in false grammar if it's not totally obvious

[2016-05-13 10:40:00 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] I’m having trouble getting Apache to autostart on a vagrant vm - Debian Wheezy OS.
[2016-05-13 10:40:08 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] It starts after boot just fine.
[2016-05-13 10:41:15 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] I’ve ran this command: sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults
[2016-05-13 10:41:28 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] But that just returns: update-rc.d: using dependency based boot sequencing
[2016-05-13 10:41:43 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] and this all because you wanted to learn how to act like a baby
[2016-05-13 10:43:04 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] Would removing it and re adding it help?

[2016-05-13 10:47:31 -0500] [mwillbanks in #debian] more or less, trying to determine a way of implementing it but i haven't found any specifics on if and how jessie will work with it yet.
[2016-05-13 10:50:22 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] 'fraid so
[2016-05-13 10:51:50 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, it should give output as to what it did
[2016-05-13 10:52:42 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, if apache is enabled you'll see it as an S entry in /etc/rc2.d/
[2016-05-13 10:53:03 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] It is. I figured out what was going wrong - it’s vagrant.
[2016-05-13 10:53:16 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, is apache running?
[2016-05-13 10:53:20 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, (netstat -plunt)
[2016-05-13 10:53:24 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] On the maching /var/www is an nfs mount.
[2016-05-13 10:53:42 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] Debian tries to start apache before vagrant completes that mount, crashing on start.
[2016-05-13 10:54:05 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] The solution is to have vagrant call for a restart at the tail of its startup script.
[2016-05-13 10:54:25 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] A little sloppy, but it’s a sandbox vm.
[2016-05-13 10:54:41 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, btw there's #vagrant
[2016-05-13 10:54:53 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] I am in that channel too.
[2016-05-13 10:55:12 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] I was unclear whether it was a Debian issue of vagrant issue when I first hit the error.
[2016-05-13 10:55:29 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] And why aren’t my fingers finding the right letter keys this morning??
[2016-05-13 10:55:50 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, i believe it's a vagrant issue
[2016-05-13 10:56:02 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] It is, but I have a solution.
[2016-05-13 10:56:04 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, apache on a true debian system always works -- i've been using apache for years actually on debian
[2016-05-13 10:56:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] akiTendo, so it surprises me, because even then "http://localhost" would be working
[2016-05-13 10:56:46 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] Read my comment above - the problem was an attempt to start the server before the drive containing all the websites is mounted.
[2016-05-13 10:58:03 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] The work around is just to let it fail then have vagrant call for start after mounting the drive.
[2016-05-13 10:58:32 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] If the machine internally reboots it should be fine - virtualbox should maintain the nfs mount in that unlikely event.
[2016-05-13 10:58:35 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] jml2: what the hell does "apache on a true debian system always works" mean?
[2016-05-13 10:59:16 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] teraflops: I think he’s referencing the fact I’m running it on a vm, not on bare metal.
[2016-05-13 10:59:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] teraflops, he said he was on #vagrant... he was already saying it was a vagrant issue
[2016-05-13 10:59:36 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] teraflops, dunno how much modifications were made on his debian template machine (it's a virtual machine)
[2016-05-13 11:00:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] (if he even bothered to read what and why)
[2016-05-13 11:00:29 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] jml2: Heh heh. Well thanks. It’s true, vm’s have their idiosyncracies.
[2016-05-13 11:00:41 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] Better than the headache that is MAMP though.
[2016-05-13 11:01:29 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] I’m trying to get my company off that monstrosity onto something where the server deployments, including the sandboxes, can be completely automated through ansible.
[2016-05-13 11:02:15 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] some providers completely rip things out of their templates.. i know for a fact ovh doesn't...
[2016-05-13 11:03:26 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] True. Still, I’m hoping a vm will be at least slightly more accurate for developing webscripts. At the very least it will be case sensitive (OSX and therefor MAMP is not)
[2016-05-13 11:03:30 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] but the issue is related to nfs if I read it properly
[2016-05-13 11:03:51 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] dunno
[2016-05-13 11:03:53 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] you'll have to find out :)
[2016-05-13 11:04:28 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] teraflops: It is, sorta. The issue is things have to happen in a certain order - the webserver needs to happen after the NFS mount completes.
[2016-05-13 11:07:11 -0500] [akiTendo in #debian] jml2: Ya. Well, I got PHP to compile and run using almost the same ./configure as Media Temple used, so I’m hoping that will be sufficient to stop surprises (almost in I left out the disable-debug flag)
[2016-05-13 11:07:14 -0500] [jair in #debian] hello guys, in today's days what determines the name of the interfaces when we are installing linux? "/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent...?
[2016-05-13 11:08:00 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jair: on debian 8? yes.  probably be different when 9 comes out
[2016-05-13 11:08:06 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, last i read there was a new convention for all linux.. dunno if debian will be adopting that -- it's what fedora is already using i think
[2016-05-13 11:08:21 -0500] [jair in #debian] I did a fresh install on a thinkpad X1 carbon 2016 and noticed that the interfaces are named something very weird
[2016-05-13 11:08:31 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jair: fresh install of what?
[2016-05-13 11:08:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] which debian release?
[2016-05-13 11:08:45 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, like enc****
[2016-05-13 11:08:51 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, yeah that would be fine :)
[2016-05-13 11:09:02 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, it's the new standard for all linux ...
[2016-05-13 11:09:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, it would start with e*
[2016-05-13 11:09:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, i've never seen it on debian "yet"

[2016-05-13 11:14:55 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, thanks ... so they are really implementing and keeping this
[2016-05-13 11:15:05 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jair: is that an actual debian installation or a derivative?
[2016-05-13 11:15:07 -0500] [jair in #debian] so it is really weird name
[2016-05-13 11:15:23 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jair: what does "lsb_release -sc" say
[2016-05-13 11:15:32 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] jml2: No, I mean, a command to flip the boolean, back and forth in .bashrc, how would profile help that?
[2016-05-13 11:15:47 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, if i had a bookmark to that year article ..  you might be able to find the explanation as to why linux is adopting this
[2016-05-13 11:15:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] RippyDippy, you mean like shopt ?
[2016-05-13 11:16:33 -0500] [jair in #debian] jelly: It is a derivative
[2016-05-13 11:16:53 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] jml2: I mean like... export, but actually globally changing the variable
[2016-05-13 11:17:11 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] jair: does it really matter? you'll get used to it. https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
[2016-05-13 11:17:13 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: you cannot change every instance of an enviroment variable in every running process.
[2016-05-13 11:17:28 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] RippyDippy, you mean for all users?
[2016-05-13 11:17:34 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Not even for yourself.
[2016-05-13 11:17:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian] jair: you want to ask in the support venue for that derivative, then
[2016-05-13 11:17:39 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] RippyDippy, you might look at /etc/environment or /etc/profile
[2016-05-13 11:17:51 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Change the variable assignment in your dot files, then log out and back in.
[2016-05-13 11:18:06 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Already-running processes will retain their variables.
[2016-05-13 11:18:12 -0500] [jair in #debian] teraflops: that is not a problem actually, the point is, can I modify it and add the name I want like eth0, eth1, or lan1, lan2 etc...
[2016-05-13 11:18:46 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] jair: why? anyway read the link I pasted above
[2016-05-13 11:18:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] greycat: I wonder why no bash or zsh enthusiast hasn't whipped up an async way to update env.vars, perhaps with a pre-prompt fucntion
[2016-05-13 11:19:10 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: I would like to flip it and then refresh my bashrc,
[2016-05-13 11:19:20 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] loging in and out would defeat the purpose
[2016-05-13 11:19:23 -0500] [jelly in #debian] it'd be just for interactive shells, but that may be good enough
[2016-05-13 11:19:29 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: in ONE SHELL?  That you can do.  Edit the .bashrc and then exec bash.  THAT ONE SHELL will be updated.
[2016-05-13 11:19:40 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: but your other 94 shells will not.
[2016-05-13 11:19:47 -0500] [jair in #debian] teraflops: thanks for the article
[2016-05-13 11:19:50 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Nor will your window manager, if you are inheriting it from a window manager, etc.

[2016-05-13 11:21:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, sometimes when "eth0" is "eth1", i can edit something in /etc/udev/rules.d/  ... but i don't know about the new convention with e* interfaces .. it may work or not
[2016-05-13 11:21:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] NoCode: it might work but you'd be stupid for using squirrelmail

[2016-05-13 11:21:23 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] A very common problem is that some people prefer to follow a step-by-step tutorial that shows them how to setup their system without reading the documentation or understanding what they are doing.  If something goes wrong, they have no clue whatsoever about where to look for hints, and they sometimes decide to start from scratch using a different tutorial.  This is not The Proper Way.
[2016-05-13 11:21:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] markybob: squirrelmail is fugly but probably better security-wise than the popular thing

[2016-05-13 11:22:41 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Hello. Does anyone know how to load third party firmware from the installer? When it asks whether to load some from removable media, I choose "Yes" while a flash drive containing it is plugged in, I hit enter, it takes a minute, then just goes back asking me again.
[2016-05-13 11:23:00 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jelly: no up to date php support...
[2016-05-13 11:23:11 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jelly: it's deserted
[2016-05-13 11:23:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] like this? https://i.imgur.com/7ZsXljO.webm
[2016-05-13 11:23:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, there's the non-free installer which includes the firmware you might need
[2016-05-13 11:23:42 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] Ok so this is not going to work I guess
[2016-05-13 11:23:57 -0500] [jair in #debian] jml2: yes it will be interesting to find out
[2016-05-13 11:24:05 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, i think you need to use the expert mode of the installer to use side-
[2016-05-13 11:24:10 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: what are you actually trying to do?
[2016-05-13 11:24:11 -0500] [m_b in #debian] hello there
[2016-05-13 11:24:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, ./side-storage
[2016-05-13 11:24:33 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, you've mentioned up that you're using a debian derivative..
[2016-05-13 11:24:38 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, so hmm
[2016-05-13 11:24:43 -0500] [jelly in #debian] markybob: 1.4-stable svn branch is 7 days old
[2016-05-13 11:25:00 -0500] [m_b in #debian] Actually I'm getting totally mad with the Debian installer program
[2016-05-13 11:25:01 -0500] [jair in #debian] jml2: no worries man, that article you gave me is excellent
[2016-05-13 11:25:05 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jelly: i did say release. releases are important.
[2016-05-13 11:25:44 -0500] [m_b in #debian] That's impossible to finish properly a basic instalation with LUKS and LVM on UEFI hardware.
[2016-05-13 11:25:46 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: I have silly if statement in my bash that prints out a bunch of rediculous WatchDogs themed stuff. It withing an if statement, meaning if $watchDogs == true, so all this silly stuff.
[2016-05-13 11:26:00 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, ? dont think i gave any XD
[2016-05-13 11:26:09 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: But I dont want it on at all times, just when I flip the switch
[2016-05-13 11:26:12 -0500] [m_b in #debian] Impossible to install grub, maybe somebody have an idea why ?
[2016-05-13 11:26:14 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: what, you mean a function?  An alias?  A script?
[2016-05-13 11:26:18 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, i mentioned lwn.net, but didnt look too far
[2016-05-13 11:26:21 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] I've only ever had to learn how to configure my server with tutorials. Some things have failed, but some other things have been learned already. A lot of people learn differently than others. I'm rather a person who learns by example and can often get things working after being shown(by tutorial). No I wouldn't have survived Linux 15 years ago. But today I can.
[2016-05-13 11:26:27 -0500] [greycat in #debian] What are you doing the variable, and where/how are you doing it?
[2016-05-13 11:26:46 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, all i recall is reading about a new convention with linux interfaces.. though i dont know how distros will handle it -- either they'll embrace it or try to keep eth0,eth1...
[2016-05-13 11:26:53 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] teraflops, What's outdated in it?
[2016-05-13 11:27:08 -0500] [jelly in #debian] markybob: yeah, but so are CVEs
[2016-05-13 11:27:08 -0500] [m_b in #debian] I'm trying a very standard installation, no exotics things, only select proposed choices
[2016-05-13 11:27:11 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: None. Its just there to prinf a few things when the terminal opens.
[2016-05-13 11:27:13 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, but the explanations as to why that is done is technical..
[2016-05-13 11:27:24 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] jelly: well apart some minor changes and a lot of happy new year commits squirrelmail looks pretty dead :P
[2016-05-13 11:27:25 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: What is "it"?  Are you typing a script?
[2016-05-13 11:27:33 -0500] [jair in #debian] jml2: thank you, yes it is interesting
[2016-05-13 11:27:42 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] NoCode: all the dovecot stuff
[2016-05-13 11:28:02 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: if it's a script or a function, and it uses a variable that you want to be able to change more easily, just have it read a value from a file instead of using an env variable.  Then you can edit the file and poof.
[2016-05-13 11:28:20 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: Its a block of printf's withing an if statement, that is literally sitting exposed in my bashrc
[2016-05-13 11:28:26 -0500] [greycat in #debian] All future invocations of the script/function will read the new value from the file instead of the stale value from the env.
[2016-05-13 11:28:29 -0500] [jelly in #debian] NoCode: if you really have to grab a tutorial and set up a complex system, I'd recommend the ones on workaround.org
[2016-05-13 11:28:51 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: Is it a FUNCTION that you define and run?  Or is it just code that is only executed once when you launch a new bash shell?
[2016-05-13 11:29:13 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: No. It is not a function. The latter. Code that is executed when I launch.
[2016-05-13 11:29:14 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] jair, here i found it https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
[2016-05-13 11:29:29 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] ^
[2016-05-13 11:29:37 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Then editing .bashrc is all that's required.  It only runs when you launch bash, so it only need to check the variable at that time.
[2016-05-13 11:29:38 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] teraflops, Thanks. jelly, thanks I'll look.
[2016-05-13 11:29:39 -0500] [jelly in #debian] NoCode: but the way they set up things is overkill if you really need a single-domain setup with normal accounts
[2016-05-13 11:29:39 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] m_b: does this computer use one of those fancy new NVME SSDs? which installer image did you download, and how did you copy it to USB?
[2016-05-13 11:29:43 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] or more like this? http://i.imgur.com/F2SaFQN.jpg
[2016-05-13 11:29:51 -0500] [greycat in #debian] It doesn't even have to be an env var, since it's not being used by child processes.
[2016-05-13 11:30:00 -0500] [jair in #debian] jml2: yes, i am reading
[2016-05-13 11:30:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] WAIT!  I HAVE AN IDEA!  Are you actually asking *HOW TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EDIT THE VALUE in .bashrc*??
[2016-05-13 11:30:48 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] jelly, Okay. I'll look anyway. thanks
[2016-05-13 11:30:54 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] NoCode: i find tutorials useful for an overview of what's involved, but it's still important to read the docs for postfix, dovecot etc so you can understand how to fix them when things go wrong
[2016-05-13 11:31:07 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: Nailed it. But globally. Perminently.
[2016-05-13 11:31:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] greycat, i never seen you so excited over a very simple issue :)
[2016-05-13 11:31:28 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Any change to .bashrc *IS* permanent, because it's a file.  This has been the source of confusion all along.
[2016-05-13 11:31:31 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] lol
[2016-05-13 11:31:48 -0500] [warsoul in #debian] hey guys how are you
[2016-05-13 11:32:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] /kick TomTomTosch stop trying to kill me with cute overload
[2016-05-13 11:32:03 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] warsoul, you're a troublemaker, i remember you
[2016-05-13 11:32:03 -0500] [greycat in #debian] We thought you were asking something entirely different (how to modify the existing instance of an env var across multiple processes) but you're actually asking "how do I edit a file"
[2016-05-13 11:32:08 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: I used export originally. But that just does it temporary for the life of the term. So its kinda useless when opening a new one resets to fals
[2016-05-13 11:32:14 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] jmcnaught, Makes sense for sure
[2016-05-13 11:32:38 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: Yes, thats why I was confused as to why this simple task was causing so much trouble.
[2016-05-13 11:32:47 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If editing .bashrc is more work than you want to use, you can still store the value in a separate file and read that in the code in .bashrc.  Then editing the value is easier, because it's not embedded inside shell code.
[2016-05-13 11:33:02 -0500] [warsoul in #debian] jml2 lol why are you saying that
[2016-05-13 11:33:04 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You don't have to export it.  It's not being used by child processes.
[2016-05-13 11:33:16 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] NoCode: yeah be careful, you dont want to put an email server out there without setting it up properly
[2016-05-13 11:33:19 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] yeah... "child" processes..
[2016-05-13 11:33:22 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] bah!
[2016-05-13 11:33:23 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Just pick a file, and have the .bashrc code read the value from the file.
[2016-05-13 11:33:26 -0500] [jelly in #debian] warsoul: I guess they're joking
[2016-05-13 11:33:35 -0500] [warsoul in #debian] jejejeje
[2016-05-13 11:33:41 -0500] [warsoul in #debian] yeah jelly
[2016-05-13 11:33:42 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] haha
[2016-05-13 11:33:53 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: I could actually just open it up. Just... It would be cool to do it with one command, obviously to alias
[2016-05-13 11:33:56 -0500] [warsoul in #debian] im learning
[2016-05-13 11:34:14 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: no, editing a .bashrc file with a stupid shell alias is not wise.
[2016-05-13 11:34:19 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] jml2, hm
[2016-05-13 11:34:23 -0500] [greycat in #debian] RippyDippy: use a separate file that has nothing else in it.
[2016-05-13 11:34:27 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Question: is there any better Debian installer images?
[2016-05-13 11:34:27 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: Nothing about this is wise
[2016-05-13 11:34:37 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Better as in containing real tools, not busybox?
[2016-05-13 11:34:42 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] I'm just tired of that *
[2016-05-13 11:35:12 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Busybox is keeping me busy looking for workarounds around it.
[2016-05-13 11:35:29 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] As an example, while I was following tutorials to get sub-domains works, I didn't realize you can use a2dissite to disable the DNS as well as a2ensite. That has helped a lot. Since now I can disable the default DNS file, still have it in the directory, but also use it to create a default DNS file to work from for my main, and sub-domains. It took me a lot of frustration(2 days) to figure out that my A Record was pointed to a defunct IP address. But
[2016-05-13 11:35:30 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] that was a lesson well learned!
[2016-05-13 11:35:32 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Can't do nothing. Bug? Strace? nope, no strace.
[2016-05-13 11:35:39 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] mmh, jelly  http://i.imgur.com/fjIDN.jpg

[2016-05-13 11:36:10 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] Can I use the Ubuntu installer to install Debian?
[2016-05-13 11:36:21 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, often folks they just end up downloading the non-free debian iso , ( http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/8.4.0-live+nonfree/amd64/iso-hybrid/ )
[2016-05-13 11:36:21 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] it's my only weapon!
[2016-05-13 11:36:26 -0500] [RippyDippy in #debian] greycat: mmmm, Unecissary files
[2016-05-13 11:36:34 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Then people demonizing me in another channel saying my directives were wrong, and why it wasn't working.
[2016-05-13 11:36:40 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, should come with the basic firmwares needed
[2016-05-13 11:36:50 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] So. That was a good resolve at least.
[2016-05-13 11:37:06 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, dude
[2016-05-13 11:37:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, what kind of question was that?
[2016-05-13 11:37:21 -0500] [m_b in #debian] jmcnaught: yes, brand new nvme SSD
[2016-05-13 11:37:28 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] jml2, fine (except I'm dealing with a 64core server that takes about 10' to run through the boot process).
[2016-05-13 11:37:44 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] jml2, but I *always* seem to be running into issues in the installer,
[2016-05-13 11:37:56 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] and *always* need some tool that's not available.
[2016-05-13 11:37:59 -0500] [m_b in #debian] I use netinstall 8.4 image downloaded from official french mirror and I put it on a USB with the dd command
[2016-05-13 11:38:28 -0500] [m_b in #debian] so Debian doesn't support nvme SSD?
[2016-05-13 11:38:31 -0500] [NoCode in #debian] Me not know why it wouldn't work, which ultimately was my fault anyway. But still!
[2016-05-13 11:38:48 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, you'll need a way to make preparation images -- use virtualbox, set it online, and use snapshots, then later clone that vbox hard-disk..   this way you can keep your production systems separate from the internet and never have to worry
[2016-05-13 11:38:59 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, isolate "/" from data stores..
[2016-05-13 11:39:18 -0500] [pflanze in #debian] I just want a decent system environment when running the installer.
[2016-05-13 11:39:25 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] pflanze, when you do updates, you just use an updated image cloned from vbox
[2016-05-13 11:39:28 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] m_b: it does but it seems some people have had a problem installing grub. i've seen a workaround where after installing Debian you boot into rescue mode and install grub manually
[2016-05-13 11:39:37 -0500] [m_b in #debian] I founded it : http://www.poweredbyjeff.com/2015/10/29/Intel-750-SSD-in-Debian-Jessie/
[2016-05-13 11:39:51 -0500] [m_b in #debian] I will try, thanks for your answers jmcnaught o/
[2016-05-13 11:40:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] m_b, maybe not the default kernel which might be too old for the latest nvm, so for that you can install the latest from backports ..
[2016-05-13 11:41:05 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] m_b, kernel 4.4 is available from backports
[2016-05-13 11:41:28 -0500] [markybob in #debian] no it's not
[2016-05-13 11:41:29 -0500] [markybob in #debian] 4.5 is
[2016-05-13 11:41:34 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] m_b, you should still be able to install on the nvm ssd (hopefully)-- so on post setup you can just add the newer kernel afterwards
[2016-05-13 11:41:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] m_b, above kernel 3.15 you'll be wanting to use
[2016-05-13 11:42:04 -0500] [markybob in #debian] jessie has 3.16, not 3.15
[2016-05-13 11:42:12 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] i didnt say jessie is 3.15
[2016-05-13 11:42:27 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] (talking in reference to actual nvm support in upstream)
[2016-05-13 11:42:45 -0500] [markybob in #debian] so by your logic jessie would work
[2016-05-13 11:43:29 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] it's what's supported in the kernel

[2016-05-13 11:57:52 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] slingbot, i think you have to define that subsystem no? otherwise it uses the default sftp that comes with sshd

[2016-05-13 12:00:49 -0500] [jml2 in #debian] slingbot, you can uninstall mysecureshell as you seem not to be needing it

[2016-05-13 12:28:31 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] no, he says that repeatedly. it's the lyrics. ~ 1:15  and later again.
[2016-05-13 12:28:37 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] maybe you meant "marvel"
[2016-05-13 12:28:50 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] no, it's marble, i'm sure.

[2016-05-13 12:40:01 -0500] [greycat in #debian] A better indication would be lots of swap used, and relatively little RAM left (including cache/buffers).

[2016-05-13 13:00:45 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] ya veo, hmm tendre que hacer un filtro para cada una, es un montonal!
[2016-05-13 13:00:54 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] Installed debian 8 on a new computer with a gtx 960. Connected 1 display to card with HDMI. Max res is 1024x768 and display is "Unknown Display", what could be the problem? Using nouveau not nvidia drivers, is that it?
[2016-05-13 13:01:34 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sprakk: yes, you're going to need newer kernel and nouveau for that card, or a matching nvidia closed driver
[2016-05-13 13:01:51 -0500] [jelly in #debian] ,v xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
[2016-05-13 13:01:52 -0500] [judd in #debian] Package: xserver-xorg-video-nouveau on amd64 -- squeeze: 1:0.0.15+git20100329+7858345-5; squeeze-backports: 1:0.0.16+git20110411+8378443-1~bpo60+1; wheezy: 1:1.0.1-5; jessie: 1:1.0.11-1; sid: 1:1.0.12-1+b1; stretch: 1:1.0.12-1+b1
[2016-05-13 13:02:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian] no backports for nouveau, that's a bad sign
[2016-05-13 13:02:19 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] jelly: ok, so nvidia proprietary driver will make it work with the current debian 8 kernel?
[2016-05-13 13:02:29 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] I mean, Boney M didn't even sing their songs
[2016-05-13 13:02:38 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] They were actors
[2016-05-13 13:02:41 -0500] [tortib in #debian-offtopic] anyone here get the new Doom?
[2016-05-13 13:02:55 -0500] [jelly in #debian] might need to pick the right version of nvidia driver but yes that's an option
[2016-05-13 13:03:06 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] but the guy had good moves!
[2016-05-13 13:03:19 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dpkg, tell sprakk about nvidia dkms
[2016-05-13 13:03:40 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dpkg, tell sprakk about non-free sources
[2016-05-13 13:03:56 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Sure thing! He didn't have to sing and could concentrate on his moves
[2016-05-13 13:04:40 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] jelly: would you go with the proprietary driver, or would it be better to try newer kernel with nouveau?
[2016-05-13 13:04:41 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] imaginate alguien escriba jajajjjjajaj
[2016-05-13 13:04:54 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] iridos doesn't have it that far. he can go and tell us if how good they are!
[2016-05-13 13:05:39 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] I think he should do that and report
[2016-05-13 13:06:22 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sprakk: I'd try both and use the option that is most stable.  Eg. nouveau couldn't survive more than 2-3 days uptime with my GT720, but this varied wildly depending on hw and driver versions.
[2016-05-13 13:06:40 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] ... is the situation better on another distro, e.g. Fedora?
[2016-05-13 13:07:03 -0500] [jelly in #debian] only if they have different versions of kernels and drivers.
[2016-05-13 13:07:04 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] Maybe they're as good as Heino was in the DIY warehouse
[2016-05-13 13:07:12 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] deb: era solo un comentario
[2016-05-13 13:07:49 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] xD
[2016-05-13 13:08:11 -0500] [jelly in #debian] so in general no, in practice you may get lucky with a particular release of a particular distro, and that would be mere coincidence an the next release might be crashy
[2016-05-13 13:08:26 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] lo que si quiero hacer es loque ha dicho un usuario en general, para armarle un flamewar xD
[2016-05-13 13:08:28 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] hmm... Well, I basically need stability and no surprises.. Would it be a good guess that Im in for a headache with "sleep" computer too? I had huge headaches with sleep failing with proprietary nvidia on Fedora22 last year.. It rebooted instead of went to sleep
[2016-05-13 13:08:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] I suspend my desktop regularly.
[2016-05-13 13:09:22 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, whta?
[2016-05-13 13:09:36 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] ok.. so your on proprietary now, and its stable? Or did I misunderstand and you got nouveau to work stable with your GT720?
[2016-05-13 13:09:42 -0500] [jelly in #debian] this got me weeks of uptime with jessie default kernel and nvidia blob.  Upgrading the kernel ruined things.
[2016-05-13 13:10:17 -0500] [jelly in #debian] right now?  I got frustrated and pulled the discrete card out and am running on 2 displays only with intel video :-|
[2016-05-13 13:10:20 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] I have all the old dooms... russian at the door, cold war, acid rain and waldsterben... meteor strikes and global warming...
[2016-05-13 13:10:26 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] I don't think I can take any new doom right now
[2016-05-13 13:10:48 -0500] [ochiottes in #debian-offtopic] snickers
[2016-05-13 13:10:59 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I tried to build my first .deb program but I get an error while installing: http://pastebin.com/SvTH2USE
[2016-05-13 13:11:14 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I watched in my control file but I dont undertsnad anything from it
[2016-05-13 13:11:17 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] so please help
[2016-05-13 13:11:19 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] some of them will probably be good for another decade or so!
[2016-05-13 13:11:32 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sprakk: (the frustration started after deciding to switch to debian testing and its newer kernel.  Things were fine with jessie default kernel and nvidia blob driver from jessie)
[2016-05-13 13:12:22 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] what about AI making humans obsolete?
[2016-05-13 13:12:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian] sprakk: and again, this can change a lot given a different card or even a different motherboard
[2016-05-13 13:12:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian-offtopic] wishful thinking
[2016-05-13 13:12:54 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] fecking volcanoes and yellowstone... dust cloud darkening the earth for 5 years...
[2016-05-13 13:12:57 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, that's just fantasy
[2016-05-13 13:12:58 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] yeah... hmm well it seems keeping default kernel and using the nvidia blob might be the best way to go for now. I wont be switching to testing, Ill just upgrade a while after debian 9 is released..
[2016-05-13 13:13:16 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] jelly: thanks for all the info, it was really helpful!
[2016-05-13 13:13:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian] it may not be the "best" anything but it certainly is a setup to try
[2016-05-13 13:13:40 -0500] [sprakk in #debian] yeah
[2016-05-13 13:13:42 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] jelly, yeah, would be neat, though... finally more time to play CandyCrush!!!11
[2016-05-13 13:13:55 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] oh, wait...
[2016-05-13 13:14:19 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] someone help me?
[2016-05-13 13:14:22 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] please
[2016-05-13 13:14:31 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] guys I am waiting over one hour
[2016-05-13 13:14:44 -0500] [deb in #debian-es-offtopic] ahh ya lo hace, lol
[2016-05-13 13:14:49 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] there was a film produced by pro7. it was about a supervolcano erupting under the fernsehturm in berlin. i have to find that one, it was pretty awesome.
[2016-05-13 13:15:00 -0500] [markybob in #debian] tim241: i don't think anyone even believes you
[2016-05-13 13:15:06 -0500] [markybob in #debian] tim241: please troll elsewhere

[2016-05-13 13:16:26 -0500] [jelly in #debian] !ask
[2016-05-13 13:16:26 -0500] [dpkg in #debian] If you have a question, just ask! For example: "I have a problem with ___; I'm running Debian version ___.

We're all volunteers; make it easy for us to help you. If you don't get an answer try a few hours later or on debian-user@lists.debian.org. See <smart questions><errors>.
[2016-05-13 13:16:38 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] yeah. it will darken the sky for decades and we will all die.
[2016-05-13 13:16:41 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] and it REALLY could go up every minute... and in a way that would possibly be felt on the whole earth
[2016-05-13 13:16:47 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] that is my actual output I followed this tutorial: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=910717
[2016-05-13 13:16:54 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] it just hasn't for the last couple of hundred years
[2016-05-13 13:17:00 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] let's drop a nuke on it.
[2016-05-13 13:17:18 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] so sorry if I am doing something wrong but com on
[2016-05-13 13:17:24 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] it would look pretty neat.

[2016-05-13 13:20:00 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] they should have gone with a different color...
[2016-05-13 13:20:00 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] just blow up 1340 km³ of stuff into the atmosphere in one go...
[2016-05-13 13:21:34 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] so we should all build a bunker and hoard food and seeds?
[2016-05-13 13:22:12 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] grow stuff with artificial light!
[2016-05-13 13:22:17 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] if you're rich enough to do that and still live in comfort... maybe not the very worst idea?
[2016-05-13 13:23:27 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] help me then?
[2016-05-13 13:23:50 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] also weapons so you can establish dominance in the society that forms afterwards.
[2016-05-13 13:23:59 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] probably
[2016-05-13 13:24:08 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I dont need anything as an dependencie the script will install it automaticly
[2016-05-13 13:24:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: well, this example seems to work exactly as expected
[2016-05-13 13:24:40 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] so what doI need to fill in if my script needs no dependencie
[2016-05-13 13:24:41 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] if you're a chap like gates or zuckerberg and the 30 million that costs to do half way properly doesn't hurt you...
[2016-05-13 13:25:01 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: you tried to install a .deb package with dpkg, it failed because the listed dependencies are not satisfied
[2016-05-13 13:25:08 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i already have my archives filled with knowledge, entertainment and every playboy centerfold since 1958.
[2016-05-13 13:25:30 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] ok but I dont need any dependencies what do I need to fill in then?
[2016-05-13 13:26:10 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] 🙌
[2016-05-13 13:26:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: don't put in any dependencies, then.
[2016-05-13 13:26:24 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] ok hold on please
[2016-05-13 13:26:40 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] plus, you create employment for a lot of people by building that thing... it's like building autobahns
[2016-05-13 13:26:54 -0500] [jelly in #debian] dpkg, tell tim241 about nmg
[2016-05-13 13:28:04 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] and economists try to tell us that by creating employment...well, that's like charity, only better!
[2016-05-13 13:28:10 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: you want to read about control file syntax at the very least.  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html
[2016-05-13 13:28:27 -0500] [markybob in #debian] tim241: please don't /msg me
[2016-05-13 13:28:31 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] i don't know if i would want to live in such conditions...
[2016-05-13 13:28:41 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I installed it
[2016-05-13 13:28:43 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] thx
[2016-05-13 13:29:01 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] how do I open my script then?
[2016-05-13 13:29:09 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] conditions where economists tell you how to feel about stuff? yeah... you got a point :(
[2016-05-13 13:29:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian] you've written it, why are you asking us?
[2016-05-13 13:29:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] that to. damn economists.
[2016-05-13 13:29:51 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] cheer up, they probably are
[2016-05-13 13:30:00 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] it installs on /usr/local/
[2016-05-13 13:30:03 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: how would you open it if it wasn't packaged?
[2016-05-13 13:30:16 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] just double clicking it
[2016-05-13 13:30:31 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] not double clicking it I mean
[2016-05-13 13:30:32 -0500] [jelly in #debian] is there anything stopping you from doing the same thing?
[2016-05-13 13:30:35 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] ./scriptname
[2016-05-13 13:30:51 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I want to:
[2016-05-13 13:31:06 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] well, yes, of course together with us... still...
[2016-05-13 13:31:14 -0500] [greycat in #debian] jelly: I'm not sure what he's asking because I have him on /ignore, but just to warn you, one of his #bash questions was how to wget a vbasic.exe file from Microsoft into a directory that he was *already sitting in* using wget.  So that he can use Visual Basic on his web server.
[2016-05-13 13:31:15 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] except if we DO go and build that Arch B
[2016-05-13 13:31:15 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] create a commmand in the terminal that will execute the script
[2016-05-13 13:31:38 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] laters
[2016-05-13 13:31:40 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] can i choose the animals?

[2016-05-13 13:31:44 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] bye.
[2016-05-13 13:31:46 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] no just dont
[2016-05-13 13:31:47 -0500] [greycat in #debian] After 30 minutes, he still couldn't master wget.
[2016-05-13 13:32:05 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] you should read more Hitchiker's guide books :)
[2016-05-13 13:32:06 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] this is just mean :-(
[2016-05-13 13:32:22 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch, we give you our  "#debian-offtopic recognition seal - The Most Active User Medal", congrats! https://ptpb.pw/L0so.png
[2016-05-13 13:32:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: what's the purpose of this exercise?
[2016-05-13 13:33:04 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] woohoo
[2016-05-13 13:33:06 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] .win TomTomTosch

[2016-05-13 13:33:49 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] I want to create a program that will install visual basic 2008 on linux for you it was hard to figure out but I did it so I created a script and I wanted to create a .deb file to share it with the world
[2016-05-13 13:33:49 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] can't find iridos on that. he talks about as much as i do.
[2016-05-13 13:33:54 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] sorry :-(
[2016-05-13 13:34:18 -0500] [Iridos in #debian-offtopic] mm lüpsch are scheald
[2016-05-13 13:34:33 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] jelly ^^
[2016-05-13 13:34:54 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] is it how often words are repeated?
[2016-05-13 13:35:02 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] yeah
[2016-05-13 13:35:11 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] are you guys talking about me behind my back?!
[2016-05-13 13:35:12 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: there's very little added value in packaging up a single-use installation script
[2016-05-13 13:35:40 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] and I want to add that it will add an command to /bin so if you type:
[2016-05-13 13:35:48 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] visual-studio-2008
[2016-05-13 13:35:54 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] it will start the script
[2016-05-13 13:36:25 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] And the second place goes to Iridos  https://ptpb.pw/ddIO.png
[2016-05-13 13:37:00 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: then you need your package to place the executable into a directory present in default PATH
[2016-05-13 13:37:19 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] yes
[2016-05-13 13:37:42 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] but greycat is super mean and has no idea how much effort I put into this
[2016-05-13 13:37:58 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: so do that, instead of putting the executable in /usr/local, put it in a different directory, that already is in PATH
[2016-05-13 13:38:15 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] lmao
[2016-05-13 13:38:24 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] which directory then?
[2016-05-13 13:38:41 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] deb, that's pretty cool.
[2016-05-13 13:38:47 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: do you know how to show the current PATH value?
[2016-05-13 13:38:53 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] no sorry
[2016-05-13 13:39:02 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: really?
[2016-05-13 13:39:15 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] deb: sample from the last 24h ?
[2016-05-13 13:39:22 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] no sorry I can program a little of shell script but I dont do it that much
[2016-05-13 13:39:27 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: but you're able to make a working downloader and installer for a complex software component?
[2016-05-13 13:39:35 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] yes
[2016-05-13 13:40:01 -0500] [markybob in #debian] have to say i called it
[2016-05-13 13:40:13 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] Having some issues getting GCC to find libboost, despite having installed libboost-dev-all.  ldconfig -p: http://pastebin.com/sikvj0WS, build log (non-standard buildsystem): http://ci.nexisonline.net/job/sourcemod-socket/34/console buildscript with flags: https://github.com/N3X15/sm-ext-socket/blob/master/AMBuildScript#L1
[2016-05-13 13:40:16 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: I find that hard to believe.  Use your shell skills to display the value of PATH.
[2016-05-13 13:40:17 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] yep
[2016-05-13 13:40:34 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] ah, that's why some aren't on there :)
[2016-05-13 13:40:51 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] weekends have quite different pattern
[2016-05-13 13:40:54 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] ok sorrry if I dissapoint you jelly
[2016-05-13 13:41:30 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: you're not, it was a fun exercise while it lasted.   Have a nice day.
[2016-05-13 13:41:46 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] you too :-)
[2016-05-13 13:42:57 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] it was easy to display $path
[2016-05-13 13:43:05 -0500] [tim241 in #debian]  echo $path
[2016-05-13 13:43:27 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: which debian version is this
[2016-05-13 13:43:36 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] datase, boor TomTomTosch
[2016-05-13 13:43:47 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] Release:        testing
[2016-05-13 13:43:54 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] jelly what do I need to do with the value of $path?
[2016-05-13 13:44:03 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] hmm no boor'ing as per /lastlog
[2016-05-13 13:44:12 -0500] [deb in #debian-offtopic] this is the whole debian-offtopic channel https://ptpb.pw/Ts4z.png
[2016-05-13 13:44:13 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: I never said anything about "path" or "$path".
[2016-05-13 13:44:27 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] jelly, stretch
[2016-05-13 13:44:30 -0500] [tim241 in #debian]   Use your shell skills to display the value of PATH.
[2016-05-13 13:44:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: right.
[2016-05-13 13:44:56 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] please help then?
[2016-05-13 13:45:16 -0500] [jelly in #debian] tim241: case matters.
[2016-05-13 13:45:32 -0500] [tim241 in #debian] you know my case right?
[2016-05-13 13:46:05 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] zwiebelsuppe pretty high up.
[2016-05-13 13:46:52 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] :D
[2016-05-13 13:46:59 -0500] [kc7rad in #debian] tim241: echo $PATH
[2016-05-13 13:47:02 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] yeay zwiebelsuppe
[2016-05-13 13:47:10 -0500] [kc7rad in #debian] variables are case sensitive.
[2016-05-13 13:47:13 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] .zwiebelsuppe at0m
[2016-05-13 13:47:13 -0500] [datase in #debian-offtopic] hands a steaming bowl of zwiebelsuppe to at0m
[2016-05-13 13:47:18 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] well now probably debian
[2016-05-13 13:47:18 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] He's gone kc7rad
[2016-05-13 13:47:25 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] people think really yeah
[2016-05-13 13:47:49 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] look good enough even
[2016-05-13 13:47:54 -0500] [kc7rad in #debian] N3X15  That's what happens when I try to multitask. lol
[2016-05-13 13:47:59 -0500] [jelly in #debian] alas, we hardly knew him
[2016-05-13 13:48:09 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] It's all right.  I've had an entire week like that.
[2016-05-13 13:48:32 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] will TomTomTosch guess kitten? - yes he will.
[2016-05-13 13:48:39 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] jelly, should I escalate to #debian-next?
[2016-05-13 13:48:58 -0500] [at0m in #debian-offtopic] TomTomTosch guess kitten mostly.
[2016-05-13 13:49:14 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: yes.  is there a reason you're trying to statically link with stdc++ and boost, or am I reading that wrong?
[2016-05-13 13:49:25 -0500] [jelly in #debian] er, libgcc not stdc++
[2016-05-13 13:49:38 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] It's just an old, old buildscript that I'm trying to get back into working order.
[2016-05-13 13:49:52 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: is this a 32bit or 64 system?
[2016-05-13 13:50:02 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] The guy who wrote it vanished from the face of the earth
[2016-05-13 13:50:15 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] It's a 32bit target on a 64bit host.
[2016-05-13 13:50:30 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] how save is it to move a debian installation from one machine to the other
[2016-05-13 13:50:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: is the chroot 32bit?
[2016-05-13 13:50:42 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] Nnnope.
[2016-05-13 13:50:44 -0500] [TomTomTosch in #debian-offtopic] sometimes Ubuntu, normal debian.  sounds about right.
[2016-05-13 13:50:53 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: can you make the whole chroot 32bit.
[2016-05-13 13:51:34 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] I was hoping that multi-lib thing would help me avoid doing that to a CI server :/
[2016-05-13 13:51:34 -0500] [jelly in #debian] but yeah, -next is the right place
[2016-05-13 13:51:49 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: you give multiarch in debian too much credit.
[2016-05-13 13:51:52 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] Okay, then
[2016-05-13 13:52:08 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I was hoping to copy my VMWare setup to a real drive once I got everything working smoothly and then plugging that drive in the target machine
[2016-05-13 13:52:20 -0500] [jelly in #debian] probably doable with copious amounts of :i386 stuff installed, who knows
[2016-05-13 13:52:51 -0500] [jelly in #debian] N3X15: if your CI can't set up a 32bit env. to build 32bit stuff, get a better CI
[2016-05-13 13:52:57 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] Well, ldconfig shows some i386 stuff
[2016-05-13 13:53:00 -0500] [jelly in #debian] hides
[2016-05-13 13:53:05 -0500] [N3X15 in #debian] So I assumed it would find it
[2016-05-13 13:54:55 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Quatroking: migrations to different hardware work, as long as the hardware supports your userspace.  There's a number of obvious and less obvious things to tune on a new hw platfrom.
[2016-05-13 13:55:17 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yeah I kept the vm as close to the target machine as possible
[2016-05-13 13:58:46 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Quatroking: no particular order: changes in /etc/fstab, boot loader, /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.  Additional userspace to get the filesystems up and running (lvm2, multipath-tools), if needed.  Updating initramfs.
[2016-05-13 13:59:14 -0500] [at0m in #debian] and firmware.
[2016-05-13 13:59:37 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Would I need to edit the bootloader if the bootloader is on the drive itself?
[2016-05-13 13:59:48 -0500] [jelly in #debian] you would need to install a bootloader.
[2016-05-13 13:59:53 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] plugged into the first ata channel
[2016-05-13 14:00:09 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] well yeah I have grub on the virtual drive
[2016-05-13 14:00:21 -0500] [jelly in #debian] oh, you provided the raw drive to the VM?
[2016-05-13 14:00:27 -0500] [Shentino in #debian] jelly:  now he's bothering the #debian channel over on OFTC :P
[2016-05-13 14:00:35 -0500] [jelly in #debian] Shentino: thanks
[2016-05-13 14:00:42 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I plan to use clonezilla to copy the virtual drive over to a physical drive once my setup is finished
[2016-05-13 14:01:07 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] so in the end the physical drive would be identical to the virtual one
[2016-05-13 14:01:19 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] after that I just plug it into the target machine
[2016-05-13 14:02:17 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] the only big difference I'm wary of is the change in cpu clockspeed
[2016-05-13 14:02:51 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] right now I have it limited to a single core of my i7 2700k but the target machine has a VIA C3 800mhz lol
[2016-05-13 14:03:17 -0500] [at0m in #debian] the OS wouldn't care about speed, only architecture
[2016-05-13 14:03:41 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I installed the x86 version of debian so that should be fine
[2016-05-13 14:03:52 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Wouldn't there be a noticable increase of boot time?
[2016-05-13 14:04:02 -0500] [at0m in #debian] of course
[2016-05-13 14:04:17 -0500] [at0m in #debian] cos slow disks, slow everything, compared to the i7
[2016-05-13 14:05:05 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] It'll be running MAME, mostly atari/nes games, so that should be fine
[2016-05-13 14:05:17 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] I mean, I've played nes games at full speed before on an old pentium 2
[2016-05-13 14:07:25 -0500] [deluxux in #debian] i have a powerpc mac is it possible to compile telegram-purple? https://github.com/majn/telegram-purple
[2016-05-13 14:07:29 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] uhhhhh eztv esta como que no esta ...
[2016-05-13 14:10:20 -0500] [fuaa in #debian-es] Che likevinyl
[2016-05-13 14:10:27 -0500] [fuaa in #debian-es] Ya me banearon todo el rango
[2016-05-13 14:10:31 -0500] [fuaa in #debian-es] :(
[2016-05-13 14:16:28 -0500] [sphalerite in #debian] Is there a way to get grub working on debian using the linuxefi/initrdefi commands rather than linux/initrd? As is, grub complains about an invalid signature / no signature (can't remember the exact error message, but it's regarding signatures either way). I don't think I can disable secure boot on my machine (it's a mac).
[2016-05-13 14:17:23 -0500] [deb in #debian-es] y eso?
[2016-05-13 14:21:03 -0500] [jj3 in #debian] Hi
[2016-05-13 14:22:46 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] Hi there
[2016-05-13 14:23:01 -0500] [dxsweet in #debian] HI
[2016-05-13 14:24:40 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] a quick question : I remember that in the past, in the .torrent files which are available to get the debian ISO, came checksums and signature alongside with the ISO file
[2016-05-13 14:25:07 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] is there any good reason why it is not true anymore ?
[2016-05-13 14:25:08 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Why would you trust a sum INSIDE the torrent file?
[2016-05-13 14:25:38 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] greycat: because it's a simple way to find it ?
[2016-05-13 14:26:16 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Here's a music CD of Big Famous Boy Band #45668.  It's not pirated.  You can tell because it says "Not Pirated" right here in black crayon.
[2016-05-13 14:26:22 -0500] [zykotick9 in #debian] fsirjean: i don't remember that... <- not saying you're wrong, i just don't remember that
[2016-05-13 14:26:41 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] is there a way to expand a hard disk without having to add a virtual device?
[2016-05-13 14:26:48 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] zykotick9: well, maybe i dont recall corectly
[2016-05-13 14:27:16 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] so, say my /dev/sda is 50GB and I have a virtual device /dev/sda1 that is my var and it's 10GB
[2016-05-13 14:27:17 -0500] [greycat in #debian] (A signature is different, because there the trust still comes from an external authority.)
[2016-05-13 14:27:24 -0500] [fsirjean in #debian] anyway, i'm actually totally lost in the download pages of the debian website : I just need the netinstall ISO, a checksum and a detached signature : cant't find it -_-
[2016-05-13 14:27:28 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] if I increase the hard drive to 70GB (VMWare)
[2016-05-13 14:27:41 -0500] [greycat in #debian] OH, it's a VMWare question.
[2016-05-13 14:27:43 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] can I make /dev/sda1 20GB larger -> 30GB ?
[2016-05-13 14:27:54 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] no, I already made the hard drive bigger... now I'm in Debian
[2016-05-13 14:28:11 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] Sure, but don't know if you can do it with vmware tools
[2016-05-13 14:28:20 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I think the same would apply if I backed up my system and restored it to a larger hard drive (using dd) ?
[2016-05-13 14:28:34 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] oh, I already increased the size of the hard drive
[2016-05-13 14:28:44 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I've read that you have to create a new virtual device /dev/sda2
[2016-05-13 14:28:46 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] is that true?
[2016-05-13 14:28:47 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If parted can still read the disk's partition table, identify the empty space, and create a partition in the empty space, then you're good.
[2016-05-13 14:29:02 -0500] [greycat in #debian] /dev/sda2 is a partition, not a "virtual device"
[2016-05-13 14:29:13 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] ok, sorry
[2016-05-13 14:29:14 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] Yeah I'm pretty sure I've increased the size of virtual drives before
[2016-05-13 14:29:16 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] u can do it using a live cd on the wmware
[2016-05-13 14:29:33 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] afterwards I just ran gparted off livecd and increased the partitions
[2016-05-13 14:29:34 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] erm3nda, I used gparted live and it saw the empty space
[2016-05-13 14:29:39 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] but no way to resize it
[2016-05-13 14:29:46 -0500] [Quatroking in #debian] huh, that's odd
[2016-05-13 14:29:49 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] maybe I'm doing something else wrong
[2016-05-13 14:29:53 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I must be missing a step
[2016-05-13 14:29:56 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] oh, and I have LVM
[2016-05-13 14:29:58 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] didn't show the resize option?
[2016-05-13 14:30:06 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] no
[2016-05-13 14:30:10 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] let me take a screenshot
[2016-05-13 14:30:25 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] why you didn't use vmdk expandable drives?
[2016-05-13 14:30:27 -0500] [thurstylark in #debian] is there a way to reinstall a package and all its depends?
[2016-05-13 14:31:03 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] it's best option when you don't know how much large your install will be
[2016-05-13 14:31:07 -0500] [dionysus69 in #debian] can I run debian on rooted kindle hdx?
[2016-05-13 14:31:26 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] http://172.30.255.108:8080/QuartzSchedAdmin/triggerType/list
[2016-05-13 14:31:29 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] dammit
[2016-05-13 14:31:47 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] Question: Does exist any way to add delay to the disc writting to certain partition?? I don't wanna add delay to the full drive.
[2016-05-13 14:32:32 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] avoiding disk caché writes applies to the whole drive, it's not the way
[2016-05-13 14:32:56 -0500] [teraflops in #debian-es-offtopic] Jaja
[2016-05-13 14:33:02 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] I don't know if there is any tool to manage the access to devices

[2016-05-13 14:33:10 -0500] [greycat in #debian] avoiding disk cache is also the exact opposite of what you're asking for
[2016-05-13 14:33:39 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] erm3nda, not sure how vmdk expandable drives has anything to do with this
[2016-05-13 14:33:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] In any case, the handling of disk cache flushing is done in the kernel, so maybe ask ##linux too.
[2016-05-13 14:34:18 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] DammitJim, if you use a disk that auto-resizes iftelf to your need Gb value, it's cool
[2016-05-13 14:35:06 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] erm3nda, you mean if I create my original disk to be 300G instead of 50GB and let it grow to that size?
[2016-05-13 14:35:27 -0500] [teraflops in #debian] Resizing Qemu raw images is a kids game
[2016-05-13 14:35:58 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] i mean a disk with a limit of your choice, ie 300Gb max, but it's size will be created "on the file"
[2016-05-13 14:36:22 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] so, if you installa fresh Windows 7 on that disk, maybe your virtual disk will be about 7Gb currently
[2016-05-13 14:36:30 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] the more shit you installs, the more it grows
[2016-05-13 14:36:35 -0500] [greycat in #debian] He's asking how to resize the partition, and then the LVM physical volume (or the volume group), and then the LV inside the VG.
[2016-05-13 14:36:44 -0500] [greycat in #debian] And then the file system inside the LV.
[2016-05-13 14:36:51 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] U can't expand a partition about a limited file
[2016-05-13 14:37:30 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] ok, so it sounds like I will need to just create a new partition every time we "expand" the hard drive
[2016-05-13 14:37:37 -0500] [greycat in #debian] One option that I'm about 80% sure will work is to add ANOTHER PARTITION which becomes another Physical Volume to the LVM system, and then append that new PV into the VG, and then you have more space in the VG.
[2016-05-13 14:37:51 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] or if I took a clonezilla of a machine and restore it to a machine with a larger hard drive
[2016-05-13 14:37:57 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You VM people.  I just don't get it.
[2016-05-13 14:38:01 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] greycat, you are correct about that
[2016-05-13 14:38:11 -0500] [greycat in #debian] You have all these big fancy toys and you have no idea how anything works.  But it's fancy, so it must be right.
[2016-05-13 14:38:18 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] I just thought it was a little messy in the end if we keep adding more space LOL
[2016-05-13 14:38:45 -0500] [DammitJim in #debian] it's a provisioning problem I'm trying to clean up on these 5 year old servers
[2016-05-13 14:38:46 -0500] [greycat in #debian] There may be other ways.  I don't know shit about VMware.  I don't know shit about hard drives that magically grow overnight.
[2016-05-13 14:39:35 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] https://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_disk_manager_examples.html
[2016-05-13 14:39:46 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian]  To expand the size of a virtual disk, use a command like the following:
[2016-05-13 14:39:46 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] vmware-vdiskmanager -x 40GB myDisk.vmdk
[2016-05-13 14:39:55 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] did u even read that documentation?
[2016-05-13 14:40:14 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] wich kind of virtual disk did u created?
[2016-05-13 14:40:43 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] maybe u can move the partition with gparted from your actual virtual disk to a new vmdk that you can modify
[2016-05-13 14:40:48 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] is there a recommended to set JAVA_HOME for all users in Debian? by editing /etc/profile perhaps?!
[2016-05-13 14:40:58 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] gparted should be started from a live cd
[2016-05-13 14:41:06 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] otherwise you cant unount the main drive
[2016-05-13 14:41:28 -0500] [qqz in #debian] would anyone here be so kind and help me with https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2016/05/msg00011.html?
[2016-05-13 14:41:32 -0500] [greycat in #debian] Devastator: /etc/environment is more likely to work if your users have a GUI login
[2016-05-13 14:42:08 -0500] [Devastator in #debian] greycat hum, no GUI
[2016-05-13 14:42:11 -0500] [qqz in #debian] I have tried half a day and a dozen of times to get the reports (especially the first one) posted but without success.
[2016-05-13 14:42:33 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If you're sure there will never be a GUI login user, or a (t)csh user, then  /etc/profile is fine.

[2016-05-13 15:09:44 -0500] [qqz in #debian] any help is highly appreciated
[2016-05-13 15:10:09 -0500] [qqz in #debian] it could be a security issue as well: buffer overrun in gzip
[2016-05-13 15:10:27 -0500] [qqz in #debian] unfortunately #networking and #grub is not helpful at the time
[2016-05-13 15:11:07 -0500] [qqz in #debian] you just need to post at the given address and then fill in my name and email: Elmar Stellnberger / estellnb@elstel.org

[2016-05-13 15:11:24 -0500] [greycat in #debian] qqz: Oh, it's a gzip bug?  Then run gzip --help.  The last thing it says is the EMAIL ADDRESS of where to report bugs.
[2016-05-13 15:11:33 -0500] [ryouma in #debian] qqz: that doesn't solve it.  some programs will reset the terminal to blink.
[2016-05-13 15:11:40 -0500] [qqz in #debian] no it is a grub gzio module bug

[2016-05-13 15:17:58 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] johnkeates , i did your command and it's working

[2016-05-13 15:18:59 -0500] [greycat in #debian] x-fak: anyway, the boilerplate should also be present in /etc/skel/.bashrc and you can copy from there

[2016-05-13 15:21:20 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] erm3nda , ok i do it
[2016-05-13 15:21:39 -0500] [greycat in #debian] x-fak: if you've edited .bashrc, then exec bash
[2016-05-13 15:21:42 -0500] [qqz in #debian] jmcnaught: that is what I did via email but the rports were closed quickly with the argument that they need to be filed upstreams
[2016-05-13 15:21:45 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] erm3nda , 550MB of space needed :)
[2016-05-13 15:21:53 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] yes
[2016-05-13 15:22:02 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] the lightest desktop i think is lxde
[2016-05-13 15:22:10 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] but is kinda horrible/simple
[2016-05-13 15:22:27 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] I only used that inside a 300Mhz 128Mb ram devide :V
[2016-05-13 15:22:40 -0500] [x-fak in #debian] greycat , what should i edit into .bashrc please? put a new line with . /etc/bash_completion ?

[2016-05-13 15:22:53 -0500] [leandrosansilva in #debian] Hello to all. I am using debian unstable and I tried do install using dpkg a package which is from ubuntu, but which broke everything when I 'dpkg -i' it. (libfontconfig). As it is a dependency of almost all graphic applications, the system is broken. In order to fix it, I'd like to install the old package from debian again, and solve the issue (I even have the .deb here), but apt-get insists I need to remove libfontconfig and
[2016-05-13 15:22:54 -0500] [leandrosansilva in #debian] everything depending on it, which consists on... everything
[2016-05-13 15:23:07 -0500] [greycat in #debian] If you are incapable of copying the code from /etc/skel and if you are certain you will never UNINSTALL bash-completion, then sure.  That will work.
[2016-05-13 15:23:11 -0500] [qqz in #debian] if anyone is here who cares about arbitrary code execution bugs in web browsers, email clients possibly also gpg etc. then pleaase help me get the gzio bug posted
[2016-05-13 15:23:13 -0500] [leandrosansilva in #debian] how can I fix the system, reinstalling the old package, without breaking everything?
[2016-05-13 15:23:36 -0500] [qqz in #debian] all of the web relies partially on gzip packing
[2016-05-13 15:23:42 -0500] [greycat in #debian] leandrosansilva: unstable is not supported here.  Go to the OFTC channel that supports it, per /topic.
[2016-05-13 15:23:53 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] leandrosansilva, what about using snapshots of your unstable system?
[2016-05-13 15:24:33 -0500] [rattking in #debian] leandrosansilva: this is starting to get dangerous, but you could try a 'dpkg -r --force-all libfontconfig' then a 'apt-get install libfontconfig'
[2016-05-13 15:24:36 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] writable filesystem and back-in-time over filesystem, maybe
[2016-05-13 15:26:23 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] x-fak, never use vnc connection without ssh, it's strongly unsecure. but using ssh is strongly secure ;)
[2016-05-13 15:27:37 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] the trick is to combine ssh port redirection to connect localhost on the remote host vía ssh tunnel. it's kinda easy once you know how to setup it
[2016-05-13 15:30:12 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] U only need to launch vncserver like "vncserver :1 --geometry 800x600 --localhost" to don't allow anyone from the outside listen even if no firewall is installed/configured
[2016-05-13 15:30:23 -0500] [jmcnaught in #debian] qqz: it's not that clear to me why reporting the bug didn't work for you, but according to https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-bugs.html you can also report by email. you may want to ask for help in #gnu
[2016-05-13 15:30:48 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] later you have to connect to that using a command like this "vncviewer -via root@domain -passwd ~/password(if any) localhost:5901"
[2016-05-13 15:46:00 -0500] [erm3nda in #debian] ssh root@domain -L 5901:localhost:5901
